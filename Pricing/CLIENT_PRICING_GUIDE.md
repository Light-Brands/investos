## How It Works

We deliver a complete fundraising operating system -- strategy, financials, legal architecture, market research, operations, an interactive investor platform, and a ready-to-go data room -- customized to your business and your raise. One team, one engagement, one invoice.

Your package and price are determined by two things:

1. **What you need** (which package tier)
2. **How much you're raising** (which determines scope depth)

## Pricing by Raise Size

Your raise target determines the scope depth within your chosen package tier. Larger raises require deeper financial modeling, broader investor targeting, and more comprehensive documentation.

| Raise Target | Package | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **$5M** | Launch Pad | **$75,000** |
| **$10M** | War Chest | **$200,000** |
| **$25M** | Full Arsenal | **$450,000** |
| **$50M** | Full Arsenal+ | **$600,000** |
| **$100M+** | Full Arsenal Enterprise | **$750,000** |

**Full Arsenal+ ($50M)** includes everything in Full Arsenal with enhanced financial modeling across multiple scenarios, expanded investor universe targeting (100+), multi-entity structuring documentation, and 60-day post-delivery support.

**Full Arsenal Enterprise ($100M+)** includes everything above plus institutional-grade governance documentation, LP/GP structuring support, regulatory compliance review coordination, and 90-day post-delivery support with quarterly check-ins.

> Individual service categories are also available a la carte at their standalone pricing. Mix and match based on what you already have in place.

## Three Payment Options

We offer three ways to structure your engagement. All three deliver the exact same product, the same team, and the same timeline.

---

### Option 1: Standard (50/50 Split)

Simple, straightforward. Half at kickoff, half on delivery.

| Milestone | Payment |
|---|---|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 50% of project price |
| Final deliverable handoff | 50% of project price |

**What this looks like by raise size:**

| Raise Target | Kickoff Payment | Delivery Payment | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| $5M | $37,500 | $37,500 | **$75,000** |
| $10M | $100,000 | $100,000 | **$200,000** |
| $25M | $225,000 | $225,000 | **$450,000** |
| $50M | $300,000 | $300,000 | **$600,000** |
| $100M+ | $375,000 | $375,000 | **$750,000** |

No premiums. No fees tied to your raise. Pay the listed price, get the full deliverable.

---

### Option 2: Confidence Model (30/70 Split)

We put skin in the game. You pay 30% upfront to get started, and the remaining 70% is due after your raise closes. A modest premium applies to the deferred portion to reflect the extended timeline.

| Milestone | Payment |
|---|---|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 30% of project price |
| After your capital raise closes successfully | 70% of project price + premium |

**What this looks like by raise size:**

| Raise Target | Upfront (30%) | After Raise Closes | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| $5M | $22,500 | $60,375 | **$82,875** |
| $10M | $60,000 | $157,500 | **$217,500** |
| $25M | $135,000 | $354,375 | **$489,375** |
| $50M | $180,000 | $462,000 | **$642,000** |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $577,500 | **$802,500** |

**Why it costs slightly more:** The Confidence Model includes a premium on the deferred portion (10-15% depending on raise size) that reflects the extended payment timeline. You're trading a higher total cost for a dramatically lower upfront commitment -- and the majority of your payment is funded directly from the capital you raise.

---

### Option 3: Founder's Bet (By Invitation)

For a select number of founders we have the highest conviction in, we offer our most aggressive structure. You pay 15% of the project price upfront -- just enough to kick off the engagement -- and a fixed deferred fee after your raise closes.

This isn't on a menu. We extend the Founder's Bet to founders whose businesses, teams, and raise strategies we believe in deeply enough to take the risk alongside you.

| Milestone | Payment |
|---|---|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 15% of project price |
| After your capital raise closes successfully | Fixed deferred engagement fee |

**What this looks like by raise size:**

| Raise Target | Upfront (15%) | After Raise Closes | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| $10M | $30,000 | $250,000 | **$280,000** |
| $25M | $67,500 | $625,000 | **$692,500** |
| $50M | $90,000 | $1,250,000 | **$1,340,000** |
| $100M+ | $112,500 | $2,500,000 | **$2,612,500** |

**Why the deferred fee is larger:** The Founder's Bet radically reduces your upfront commitment -- you get the complete platform for a fraction of the standard cost on Day 1. The deferred fee reflects the full scope and value of what we deliver, paid from your raise proceeds after your round closes. For context, the total deferred fee is a small fraction of the capital you're raising -- and well below what a traditional investment bank charges as a success fee (3-6% of your raise).

> The Founder's Bet is available for raises of $10M+ and is extended by invitation only.

## Deferred Payment Terms

If you choose the Confidence Model or the Founder's Bet, here's how the deferred payment works. These terms apply to both structures.

### What counts as a "successful raise"

Your raise is considered successful when you've received investment commitments totaling **50% or more of your target amount** from non-affiliated investors.

| If Your Raise Target Is... | Success Threshold |
|---|---|
| $5M | $2,500,000 |
| $10M | $5,000,000 |
| $25M | $12,500,000 |
| $50M | $25,000,000 |
| $100M+ | $50,000,000 |

### Payment timeline

| Window | Details |
|---|---|
| **Standard window** | 12 months from final deliverable handoff. Deferred balance is due within 30 days of a successful raise, or at the 12-month mark, whichever comes first. |
| **Extension (if needed)** | Available by mutual agreement out to 18 months. A 5% escalation applies to the remaining deferred balance. |
| **Hard cap** | 18 months. Full deferred amount due regardless of raise status. |

### Deliverable ownership

- You receive a license to use all deliverables for fundraising purposes immediately upon delivery.
- Full ownership of all deliverables transfers to you when the final payment is received.

### Quarterly check-ins

- We schedule brief quarterly check-ins (30 minutes) to stay aligned on your raise progress and provide any support needed.
- These check-ins are required to maintain your active engagement status.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I mix and match categories from different tiers?**
Yes. Individual categories are available a la carte. If you already have a financial model but need market research and an investor platform, we can scope that.

**Is the Confidence Model available for every raise size?**
The Confidence Model is available for qualified engagements across all raise sizes. We'll discuss eligibility during your initial consultation.

**How do I qualify for the Founder's Bet?**
The Founder's Bet is extended by invitation to founders we have the highest conviction in. It's available for raises of $10M+ and is based on our assessment of your business, team, market timing, and raise readiness. You don't need to apply -- if we believe you're a fit, we'll bring it to you.

**What if my raise takes longer than 12 months?**
We include a standard 12-month window with the option to extend to 18 months. We want to give you every chance to succeed.

**Can I pay the deferred balance from raise proceeds?**
That's exactly what both the Confidence Model and the Founder's Bet are designed for. Your balance is due after your raise closes -- funded directly from the capital you've raised.

**Are there any success fees or hidden costs?**
No. All three payment options are fixed-price engagements. Every fee is a fixed dollar amount agreed upfront -- there are no success fees, no percentage of your raise, and no hidden costs. The price you see is the price you pay.

**Why is the Founder's Bet deferred fee higher than the other options?**
The Founder's Bet gives you the lowest upfront commitment of any option -- as low as $30,000 to get started on a full engagement. The deferred fee reflects the full value of the platform you receive, and it's funded entirely from your raise proceeds. For perspective, the total is a fraction of what a traditional investment bank charges as a success fee (3-6% of your raise).

**What if I need changes after delivery?**
Post-delivery support windows are included based on your tier. Full Arsenal+ includes 60-day support; Full Arsenal Enterprise includes 90-day support with quarterly check-ins. Additional support beyond the included window can be scoped separately.
