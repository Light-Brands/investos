## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines how we structure deals for the Fundraising Infrastructure Platform. While the [Service Pricing document](FUNDRAISING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRICING.md) defines **what we sell and at what price**, this guide defines **when to offer which payment structure**, the math behind each option, margin thresholds, risk controls, and sales positioning.

### Three Payment Structures

| Structure | Split | Premium | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **50/50 Standard** | 50% kickoff / 50% delivery | None | Default. Fast cash, zero collection risk. |
| **30/70 Deferred ("Confidence Model")** | 30% upfront / 70% after raise closes | 10-15% on deferred portion | Market-share grab. Lower barrier to entry converts more deals. |
| **15/Deferred ("Founder's Bet")** | 15% upfront / deferred fee after raise closes | Deferred = 2.5% of raise target | High-conviction play. Near-cost entry for founders we believe in. Massive deferred upside. |

### Five Raise Tiers

| Raise Target | Package | Price Point |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| $5M | Launch Pad | $75K |
| $10M | War Chest | $200K |
| $25M | Full Arsenal | $450K |
| $50M | Full Arsenal+ | $600K |
| $100M+ | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $750K |

### Core Thesis

The 50/50 structure maximizes per-deal cash flow. The 30/70 structure maximizes deal volume by lowering the upfront commitment barrier. The Founder's Bet structure maximizes per-deal upside by accepting near-cost upfront in exchange for a raise-linked deferred fee — deployed selectively on the highest-conviction founders.

The 30% upfront covers internal delivery costs at every tier with 1.5x-2.4x headroom. The 70% deferred portion is 100% margin.

The 15% upfront on the Founder's Bet is at or near delivery cost. The deferred 2.5% of raise target is 100% margin and represents outsized returns on successful deals — particularly at larger raise sizes.

---

## 2. Package-to-Raise-Size Mapping

Our three published package tiers (see [Service Pricing](FUNDRAISING_PLATFORM_SERVICE_PRICING.md#package-tiers)) map to five raise-size tiers for payment structuring purposes:

| Raise Target | Package | Published Range | Deal Price | Rationale |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| **$5M** | Launch Pad | $75K - $150K | **$75K** | Entry-level raise. Floor pricing to capture deal flow. |
| **$10M** | War Chest | $150K - $300K | **$200K** | Mid-range War Chest. Standard growth-stage engagement. |
| **$25M** | Full Arsenal | $350K - $750K | **$450K** | Mid-range Full Arsenal. Full 9-category deployment. |
| **$50M** | Full Arsenal+ | $350K - $750K | **$600K** | Enhanced Full Arsenal with deeper financial modeling, expanded investor targeting, and multi-jurisdiction structuring. |
| **$100M+** | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $350K - $750K | **$750K** | Full Arsenal ceiling. Maximum scope depth across all categories, dedicated senior oversight, extended support window. |

The $50M and $100M+ tiers are not new packages — they are depth extensions of Full Arsenal. Pricing stays within the published $350K-$750K range. The premium over the base $450K is justified by incremental scope:

- **$50M ($600K):** Enhanced financial modeling with multiple scenario analyses, expanded investor universe targeting (100+ vs. 50+), multi-entity structuring documentation, and 60-day post-delivery support.
- **$100M+ ($750K):** Everything above plus institutional-grade governance documentation, LP/GP structuring support, regulatory compliance review coordination, and 90-day post-delivery support with quarterly check-ins.

## 3. Structure 1: 50/50 Standard

### How It Works

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 50% of deal price | Day 0 |
| Final deliverable handoff | 50% of deal price | Day 14-30 (per package timeline) |

### Pricing by Tier

| Raise | Deal Price | Kickoff (50%) | Delivery (50%) | Total |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $37,500 | $37,500 | **$75,000** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $100,000 | $100,000 | **$200,000** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $225,000 | $225,000 | **$450,000** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $300,000 | $300,000 | **$600,000** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $375,000 | $375,000 | **$750,000** |

### Characteristics

- **Total cost to client:** Listed price. No premium.
- **Cash flow:** Immediate. 50% collected before any work begins.
- **Collection risk:** Near zero. Second payment due on delivery — client has already committed half and wants the deliverables.
- **When to use:** Default structure. Always lead with 50/50.

---

## 4. Structure 2: 30/70 Deferred (Confidence Model)

### How It Works

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 30% of deal price | Day 0 |
| Successful capital raise | 70% of deal price + premium | Within 12 months of delivery |

A **tiered premium** is applied to the deferred 70% portion to compensate for time value of money, collection risk, and extended engagement. The premium scales inversely with raise size — higher at smaller tiers (greater default risk), lower at larger tiers (stronger completion rates).

### Pricing by Tier

| Raise | Upfront (30%) | Base Deferred (70%) | Premium Rate | Premium Amount | Total Deferred | Grand Total |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $52,500 | 15.0% | $7,875 | **$60,375** | **$82,875** |
| $10M | $60,000 | $140,000 | 12.5% | $17,500 | **$157,500** | **$217,500** |
| $25M | $135,000 | $315,000 | 12.5% | $39,375 | **$354,375** | **$489,375** |
| $50M | $180,000 | $420,000 | 10.0% | $42,000 | **$462,000** | **$642,000** |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $525,000 | 10.0% | $52,500 | **$577,500** | **$802,500** |

### Premium Rationale

| Tier | Premium | Justification |
|------|---------|---------------|
| $5M | 15% | Highest default risk. Smaller raises have lower completion rates (~55%). Thinnest cost-coverage margin. |
| $10M | 12.5% | Moderate risk. Growth-stage companies with some traction. ~60% completion rate. |
| $25M | 12.5% | Moderate risk. Larger raises but still venture-stage. ~65% completion rate. |
| $50M | 10% | Lower risk. Established companies with revenue. ~70% completion rate. |
| $100M+ | 10% | Lowest risk. Late-stage or institutional-grade companies. ~75% completion rate. |

### Characteristics

- **Total cost to client (if raise succeeds):** 10-15% above listed price. Framed as "aligned incentives," not a surcharge.
- **Cash flow:** Front-loaded cost coverage only. Profit realization deferred.
- **Collection risk:** Material. Dependent on external fundraising outcome.
- **When to use:** Qualified deals only. Client shows strong fundamentals but has legitimate budget constraints on upfront spend.

## 5. Structure 3: 15/Deferred (Founder's Bet)

### Overview

The Founder's Bet is reserved for founders we have the highest conviction in. The client pays 15% of the base deal price upfront — effectively at or near our delivery cost — and a fixed deferred fee after the raise closes. The deferred fee is calculated internally as **2.5% of the raise target** but is presented to the client as a fixed dollar amount, never as a percentage of the raise.

> **CRITICAL:** The 2.5% formula is strictly internal. Client-facing materials show fixed dollar amounts only. We never describe this as a "percentage of the raise" or a "success fee." It is positioned as a fixed deferred engagement fee.

### How It Works

| Milestone | Payment | Timing |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Contract execution + kickoff | 15% of base deal price | Day 0 |
| Successful capital raise | Fixed deferred fee (= 2.5% of raise target) | Within 12 months of delivery |

### The Math

The deferred fee is calculated as 2.5% of the target raise amount:

| Raise Target | 2.5% Calculation | Deferred Fee |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| $5,000,000 | $5M x 0.025 | **$125,000** |
| $10,000,000 | $10M x 0.025 | **$250,000** |
| $25,000,000 | $25M x 0.025 | **$625,000** |
| $50,000,000 | $50M x 0.025 | **$1,250,000** |
| $100,000,000 | $100M x 0.025 | **$2,500,000** |

### Pricing by Tier

| Raise | Base Deal Price | Upfront (15%) | Deferred Fee (2.5% of Raise) | Grand Total |
|-------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $11,250 | $125,000 | **$136,250** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $30,000 | $250,000 | **$280,000** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $67,500 | $625,000 | **$692,500** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $90,000 | $1,250,000 | **$1,340,000** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $112,500 | $2,500,000 | **$2,612,500** |

### Deferred Fee as Multiple of Base Price

| Raise | Base Price | Grand Total | Multiple of Base Price |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $136,250 | **1.82x** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $280,000 | **1.40x** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $692,500 | **1.54x** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $1,340,000 | **2.23x** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $2,612,500 | **3.48x** |

At $50M+ raises, the Founder's Bet generates 2-3.5x the base deal price. This is the structural upside that justifies accepting near-cost upfront.

### Why This Works

**The founder's perspective:** The upfront commitment is radically lower than any other option. A founder raising $25M pays $67,500 to get started — instead of $225,000 (50/50) or $135,000 (30/70). The deferred fee is a fixed amount funded from raise proceeds. From the founder's perspective, $625,000 out of a $25M raise is 2.5% of capital raised — a fraction of what a traditional investment bank charges (3-6% success fee = $750K-$1.5M).

**Our perspective:** We accept delivery-cost-level upfront in exchange for a deferred fee that scales with raise size. The upside is asymmetric — our cost is fixed, but the deferred fee grows linearly with the raise target. On $50M+ deals, a single successful Founder's Bet generates more revenue than 2-3 standard 50/50 engagements.

### Characteristics

- **Total cost to client (if raise succeeds):** 1.4x-3.5x the base deal price. Higher than other structures but framed as lower than traditional IB success fees (3-6% of raise).
- **Cash flow:** Minimal upfront. At or near delivery cost. Profit realization entirely deferred.
- **Collection risk:** High. 100% of profit is dependent on raise success.
- **When to use:** Highest-conviction founders only. Internal nomination required. This is not a sales conversion tool — it is an investment thesis.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Raise | Package | 50/50 Total | 30/70 Total | Founder's Bet Total |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| $5M | Launch Pad | $75,000 | $82,875 | $136,250 |
| $10M | War Chest | $200,000 | $217,500 | $280,000 |
| $25M | Full Arsenal | $450,000 | $489,375 | $692,500 |
| $50M | Full Arsenal+ | $600,000 | $642,000 | $1,340,000 |
| $100M+ | Full Arsenal Enterprise | $750,000 | $802,500 | $2,612,500 |

### Effective Total Premium Over 50/50

| Raise | 30/70 Premium | Founder's Bet Premium |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------|
| $5M | +$7,875 (+10.5%) | +$61,250 (+81.7%) |
| $10M | +$17,500 (+8.8%) | +$80,000 (+40.0%) |
| $25M | +$39,375 (+8.8%) | +$242,500 (+53.9%) |
| $50M | +$42,000 (+7.0%) | +$740,000 (+123.3%) |
| $100M+ | +$52,500 (+7.0%) | +$1,862,500 (+248.3%) |

> **Note:** The Founder's Bet "premium" looks large in percentage terms against the base deal price, but from the client's perspective, the total deferred fee is 2.5% of their raise — well below traditional IB success fees. The framing matters: this is not a premium on our services, it is a fixed fee that is small relative to the capital being raised.

### Cash Flow Comparison (Day 0 Collections)

| Raise | 50/50 Day 0 | 30/70 Day 0 | Founder's Bet Day 0 |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| $5M | $37,500 | $22,500 | $11,250 |
| $10M | $100,000 | $60,000 | $30,000 |
| $25M | $225,000 | $135,000 | $67,500 |
| $50M | $300,000 | $180,000 | $90,000 |
| $100M+ | $375,000 | $225,000 | $112,500 |

The Founder's Bet collects 70% less cash on Day 0 than the 50/50 structure and 50% less than the 30/70. This is the cost of maximum barrier reduction. It is recovered — with significant premium — when the raise closes.

## 7. Margin & Cost Coverage Analysis

### Internal Delivery Costs

Our AI-driven delivery model achieves 96-98% cost reduction versus traditional consulting assembly. Internal delivery costs by package:

| Package | Delivery Cost Range | Midpoint |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| Launch Pad ($5M) | $8,000 - $15,000 | $11,500 |
| War Chest ($10M) | $18,000 - $35,000 | $26,500 |
| Full Arsenal ($25M) | $30,000 - $60,000 | $45,000 |
| Full Arsenal+ ($50M) | $40,000 - $75,000 | $57,500 |
| Full Arsenal Enterprise ($100M+) | $50,000 - $100,000 | $75,000 |

> Costs include: AI compute, human senior review, legal coordination, platform hosting, and client management overhead. They do not include sales/marketing cost of acquisition.

### 50/50 Margin Analysis

| Raise | Revenue | Cost (Mid) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| $5M | $75,000 | $11,500 | $63,500 | **84.7%** |
| $10M | $200,000 | $26,500 | $173,500 | **86.8%** |
| $25M | $450,000 | $45,000 | $405,000 | **90.0%** |
| $50M | $600,000 | $57,500 | $542,500 | **90.4%** |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $75,000 | $675,000 | **90.0%** |

### 30/70 Margin Analysis (Raise Succeeds)

| Raise | Revenue | Cost (Mid) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| $5M | $82,875 | $11,500 | $71,375 | **86.1%** |
| $10M | $217,500 | $26,500 | $191,000 | **87.8%** |
| $25M | $489,375 | $45,000 | $444,375 | **90.8%** |
| $50M | $642,000 | $57,500 | $584,500 | **91.0%** |
| $100M+ | $802,500 | $75,000 | $727,500 | **90.7%** |

### 30/70 Worst Case (Raise Fails — Upfront Only)

| Raise | Upfront Collected | Cost (Mid) | Profit / (Loss) | Margin |
|-------|-------------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| $5M | $22,500 | $11,500 | $11,000 | 48.9% |
| $10M | $60,000 | $26,500 | $33,500 | 55.8% |
| $25M | $135,000 | $45,000 | $90,000 | 66.7% |
| $50M | $180,000 | $57,500 | $122,500 | 68.1% |
| $100M+ | $225,000 | $75,000 | $150,000 | 66.7% |

**Key insight:** Even in the worst case (raise fails entirely), the 30% upfront covers all delivery costs and generates positive margin at every tier. The $5M tier is thinnest at $11,000 profit — this is why $5M deals on 30/70 require the highest qualification bar.

### Founder's Bet Margin Analysis (Raise Succeeds)

| Raise | Revenue | Cost (Mid) | Gross Profit | Gross Margin |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| $5M | $136,250 | $11,500 | $124,750 | **91.6%** |
| $10M | $280,000 | $26,500 | $253,500 | **90.5%** |
| $25M | $692,500 | $45,000 | $647,500 | **93.5%** |
| $50M | $1,340,000 | $57,500 | $1,282,500 | **95.7%** |
| $100M+ | $2,612,500 | $75,000 | $2,537,500 | **97.1%** |

When the raise succeeds, the Founder's Bet produces the highest margins of any structure. The $100M+ tier generates $2.5M+ in gross profit from a single engagement — more than 3x the 50/50 revenue on the same deal.

### Founder's Bet Worst Case (Raise Fails — Upfront Only)

| Raise | Upfront Collected | Cost (Mid) | Profit / (Loss) | Margin |
|-------|-------------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| $5M | $11,250 | $11,500 | **($250)** | **-2.2%** |
| $10M | $30,000 | $26,500 | $3,500 | 11.7% |
| $25M | $67,500 | $45,000 | $22,500 | 33.3% |
| $50M | $90,000 | $57,500 | $32,500 | 36.1% |
| $100M+ | $112,500 | $75,000 | $37,500 | 33.3% |

**Key insight:** The $5M tier produces a **net loss** if the raise fails — the 15% upfront ($11,250) does not cover midpoint delivery costs ($11,500). This is the only structure and tier combination where we lose money on a failed raise. At $10M+ tiers, the upfront covers costs but with razor-thin margins. This is why the Founder's Bet requires the highest qualification bar of any structure and should never be offered at the $5M tier.

### Founder's Bet Worst Case (Against High-End Costs)

| Raise | Upfront Collected | Cost (High) | Profit / (Loss) | Margin |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| $5M | $11,250 | $15,000 | **($3,750)** | **-33.3%** |
| $10M | $30,000 | $35,000 | **($5,000)** | **-16.7%** |
| $25M | $67,500 | $60,000 | $7,500 | 11.1% |
| $50M | $90,000 | $75,000 | $15,000 | 16.7% |
| $100M+ | $112,500 | $100,000 | $12,500 | 11.1% |

Against high-end costs, the $5M and $10M tiers both produce losses if the raise fails. The $25M+ tiers remain profitable but thin. **This structure is designed for high-conviction deals where we have strong confidence in the raise outcome — the upfront is not meant to be a profit center.**

### Cost Coverage Multiples

| Raise | 50/50 Kickoff (50%) | 30/70 Upfront (30%) | Founder's Bet Upfront (15%) | Cost (Mid) |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| $5M | 3.3x | 2.0x | **0.98x** | $11,500 |
| $10M | 3.8x | 2.3x | **1.13x** | $26,500 |
| $25M | 5.0x | 3.0x | **1.50x** | $45,000 |
| $50M | 5.2x | 3.1x | **1.57x** | $57,500 |
| $100M+ | 5.0x | 3.0x | **1.50x** | $75,000 |

The Founder's Bet upfront is below 1x cost coverage at the $5M tier and barely above 1x at $10M. At $25M+, coverage is 1.5x — adequate but thin. This is by design: we are intentionally accepting near-cost upfront in exchange for deferred upside.

## 8. Risk Framework

### Risk Categories

| Risk | 50/50 Exposure | 30/70 Exposure | Founder's Bet Exposure | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Non-payment (delivery milestone)** | Moderate — client owes 50% on delivery | N/A — no delivery payment | N/A — no delivery payment | Standard contract enforcement |
| **Non-payment (raise-contingent)** | N/A | High — 70% contingent on external outcome | Very High — 100% of profit contingent on external outcome | Premium pricing, qualification gates, contractual protections |
| **Raise failure** | None — fully collected regardless | Material — deferred portion never collected | Critical — entire profit lost; potential net loss at $5M-$10M | Highest qualification bar, $10M+ only, portfolio cap |
| **Raise delay** | None | Moderate — cash flow timing risk | High — larger deferred amounts amplify timing impact | 12-month window with escalation clauses |
| **Scope creep** | Low | Moderate — longer engagement lifecycle | Moderate — longer engagement lifecycle | Deliverable-locked scope; changes require amendment |
| **Client abandonment** | Low — minimal post-delivery interaction | Moderate — must track raise progress | Moderate — must track raise progress | Quarterly check-ins, abandonment triggers |
| **Portfolio concentration** | N/A | High if too many 30/70 deals | Very High — large deferred amounts amplify concentration risk | Hard cap: max 3 active Founder's Bet engagements |

### Risk-Adjusted Expected Value

Using estimated raise success rates to compute expected revenue per deal:

| Raise | Success Rate | 50/50 EV | 30/70 EV | Founder's Bet EV |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| $5M | 55% | $75,000 | $55,706 | $80,000 |
| $10M | 60% | $200,000 | $154,500 | $180,000 |
| $25M | 65% | $450,000 | $365,344 | $473,750 |
| $50M | 70% | $600,000 | $503,400 | $965,000 |
| $100M+ | 75% | $750,000 | $658,125 | $1,987,500 |

> **Founder's Bet EV formula:** Upfront + (Success Rate x Deferred Fee)

> Example ($25M): $67,500 + (0.65 x $625,000) = $67,500 + $406,250 = **$473,750**

### Expected Value Comparison vs. 50/50

| Raise | Founder's Bet EV | vs. 50/50 | vs. 30/70 |
|-------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| $5M | $80,000 | +6.7% | +43.6% |
| $10M | $180,000 | -10.0% | +16.5% |
| $25M | $473,750 | +5.3% | +29.7% |
| $50M | $965,000 | +60.8% | +91.7% |
| $100M+ | $1,987,500 | +165.0% | +202.0% |

**Key insight:** The Founder's Bet has higher expected value than both other structures at $25M+ raises — and dramatically higher at $50M+. At $10M, the EV is 10% below 50/50, reflecting the thin upfront and moderate success rate. At $5M, the EV is slightly above 50/50 only because the deferred fee ($125K) is large relative to the base deal price ($75K) — but the negative worst-case makes this tier unacceptable.

**Recommended tiers for Founder's Bet: $10M+ only.** The $5M tier is excluded because it produces a net loss on raise failure and the upfront is below delivery cost.

### The Volume Thesis

On a per-deal basis, 30/70 has 12-26% lower expected value than 50/50. The strategic thesis is that the lower upfront barrier converts significantly more deals:

| Scenario | 50/50 Deals | 50/50 Portfolio EV | 30/70 Deals | 30/70 Portfolio EV |
|----------|------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| $10M tier, 1.5x volume | 10 | $2,000,000 | 15 | $2,317,500 |
| $25M tier, 2x volume | 5 | $2,250,000 | 10 | $3,653,440 |
| $50M tier, 1.5x volume | 4 | $2,400,000 | 6 | $3,020,400 |
| Mixed portfolio, 1.75x | 10 | $3,500,000 | 17-18 | $4,500,000+ |

**Break-even conversion multiplier:** 30/70 matches 50/50 portfolio EV when it generates ~1.3x the deal volume. Anything above that is pure upside.

The Founder's Bet does not operate on a volume thesis. It operates on a **conviction thesis** — a small number of high-confidence bets with outsized per-deal returns. Even a single successful Founder's Bet at $50M ($1.34M revenue) outperforms two standard 50/50 deals at $50M ($1.2M revenue).

## 9. Deal Qualification Criteria

### Qualification Scoring Rubric

Every prospective 30/70 or Founder's Bet engagement must pass a structured qualification assessment. Score each factor 1-5:

| Factor | Weight | 1 (Weak) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Strong) |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Business Viability** | 25% | Pre-revenue, unvalidated concept | MVP with early revenue or strong LOIs | Proven revenue, clear unit economics |
| **Fundraising Readiness** | 20% | No materials, no strategy | Some materials, general plan | Prior raise experience, clear use of proceeds |
| **Team Quality** | 15% | Solo founder, no domain expertise | Small team with relevant experience | Experienced team with exits or institutional backgrounds |
| **Market Timing** | 15% | Contracting market or unclear thesis | Stable market with identifiable opportunity | Hot sector with demonstrated investor appetite |
| **Investor Pipeline** | 15% | No investor relationships | Warm introductions, some interest | Active conversations, term sheet potential |
| **Raise Size Credibility** | 10% | Target far exceeds business stage | Target is ambitious but defensible | Target matches stage, comps, and market norms |

### Scoring Thresholds

| Score | 30/70 Decision | Founder's Bet Decision |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| **4.5 - 5.0** | Strong candidate. Proceed with standard terms. | **Eligible for Founder's Bet.** Internal nomination required. |
| **4.0 - 4.4** | Strong candidate. Proceed with standard terms. | Not eligible. Offer 30/70 instead. |
| **3.5 - 3.9** | Qualified with conditions. Consider requiring higher upfront (35-40%) or shorter window. | Not eligible. |
| **3.0 - 3.4** | Marginal. 30/70 only at $10M+ tiers. Decline at $5M. | Not eligible. |
| **Below 3.0** | Do not offer 30/70. 50/50 only, or decline engagement. | Not eligible. |

### Tier-Specific Minimums

| Raise | 30/70 Minimum Score | Founder's Bet Minimum Score | Founder's Bet Eligible? |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| $5M | **3.5** | N/A | **No.** Upfront below cost. Never offer. |
| $10M | **3.0** | **4.5** | Yes — with internal approval. Thinnest viable margin. |
| $25M | **3.0** | **4.5** | Yes — strong candidate tier. |
| $50M | **3.0** | **4.5** | Yes — excellent upside. |
| $100M+ | **3.0** | **4.5** | Yes — maximum upside. Preferred tier. |

### Founder's Bet Additional Qualification Requirements

Beyond the standard scoring rubric, Founder's Bet candidates must meet **all** of the following:

1. **Internal nomination:** At least one senior team member must formally nominate the founder and provide a written conviction thesis.
2. **Raise size $10M+:** The $5M tier is excluded due to negative worst-case economics.
3. **Score >= 4.5:** The highest qualification bar of any structure.
4. **Active investor conversations:** The founder must have existing warm relationships with at least 3 institutional investors or have a credible introduction path.
5. **Revenue or equivalent traction:** Pre-revenue companies are not eligible. The company must demonstrate revenue, binding LOIs, or equivalent commercial traction.
6. **Founder commitment:** Full-time founder dedication to the raise, with a clear timeline and use of proceeds.

### Automatic Disqualifiers (Any Tier, Any Structure)

- No legal entity formed
- Active litigation that would impair fundraising
- Founder unable to commit full-time to the raise
- Regulatory barriers with no clear resolution path
- Prior raise attempt failed with no material change in circumstances

## 10. Payment Triggers, Protections & Contractual Terms

### Definition of "Successful Raise"

A raise is deemed successful when the client has received aggregate investment commitments of **50% or more of the stated target amount** from **non-affiliated investors** (i.e., not founders, family members, or entities controlled by founders).

| Raise Target | Success Threshold (50%) |
|--------------|------------------------|
| $5M | $2,500,000 |
| $10M | $5,000,000 |
| $25M | $12,500,000 |
| $50M | $25,000,000 |
| $100M+ | $50,000,000 |

### Payment Windows

These windows apply to both the 30/70 Confidence Model and the Founder's Bet:

| Window | Duration | Terms |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Standard** | 12 months from final deliverable handoff | Full deferred amount due within 30 days of successful raise or 12-month expiry, whichever comes first. |
| **Extension** | 12-18 months | Available by mutual agreement. +5% premium escalation on remaining deferred balance. |
| **Hard Cap** | 18 months | Absolute deadline. Full deferred amount (with escalation) due regardless of raise status. |

### Escalation Math (30/70)

If a client extends from 12 to 18 months, an additional 5% premium applies to the deferred balance:

| Raise | Original Deferred | +5% Escalation | Extended Total Deferred |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| $5M | $60,375 | $3,019 | $63,394 |
| $10M | $157,500 | $7,875 | $165,375 |
| $25M | $354,375 | $17,719 | $372,094 |
| $50M | $462,000 | $23,100 | $485,100 |
| $100M+ | $577,500 | $28,875 | $606,375 |

### Escalation Math (Founder's Bet)

| Raise | Original Deferred | +5% Escalation | Extended Total Deferred |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| $10M | $250,000 | $12,500 | $262,500 |
| $25M | $625,000 | $31,250 | $656,250 |
| $50M | $1,250,000 | $62,500 | $1,312,500 |
| $100M+ | $2,500,000 | $125,000 | $2,625,000 |

### Contractual Protections

**Deliverable Licensing**
- All deliverables are **licensed, not transferred** until full payment is received.
- Client receives a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use deliverables for fundraising purposes only.
- Full ownership transfers upon receipt of final payment.
- If payment is never received, license terminates and deliverables must be returned or destroyed.

**Quarterly Check-ins**
- Client must participate in quarterly progress check-ins (30-minute calls) to maintain active engagement status.
- Two consecutive missed check-ins = **deemed abandonment**.
- Deemed abandonment triggers immediate payment obligation for the full deferred amount.

**Acquisition Clawback**
- If the client company is acquired (asset sale, stock sale, or merger) before the deferred payment is made, the full deferred amount becomes immediately due from transaction proceeds.
- Clawback applies regardless of whether the capital raise was completed.
- Structured as a first-priority claim against transaction proceeds in the engagement agreement.

**Portfolio Caps**
- Maximum **5 active 30/70 engagements** at any time.
- Maximum **3 active Founder's Bet engagements** at any time.
- 30/70 and Founder's Bet caps are independent — you can have 5 active 30/70 + 3 active Founder's Bet simultaneously.
- "Active" = contract signed, deferred payment outstanding, within the payment window.
- The 30/70 cap limits aggregate downside exposure to ~$300K in deferred delivery costs (5 deals x $60K avg cost) while maintaining upside potential of $1.6M-$2.9M in deferred revenue.
- The Founder's Bet cap limits aggregate downside exposure to ~$135K in delivery costs (3 deals x $45K avg cost) while maintaining upside potential of $1.1M-$7.5M in deferred revenue.
- When either cap is reached, all new engagements of that type must wait until an active engagement resolves.

## 11. Sales Positioning Guide

### The Golden Rule

**Always lead with 50/50.** The 30/70 structure is introduced only when:
1. The client is qualified (Score >= 3.0, tier-adjusted minimum met)
2. The client has expressed genuine budget constraints on upfront spend
3. The deal would otherwise be lost

The 30/70 is a conversion tool, not a default offer.

### The Founder's Bet Rule

**The Founder's Bet is never presented in a sales conversation.** It is offered proactively by us to founders we have the highest conviction in. It is an invitation, not a menu item.

The Founder's Bet is introduced only when:
1. The founder scores >= 4.5 on the qualification rubric
2. A senior team member has formally nominated the founder
3. The raise is $10M+
4. We genuinely believe this founder will close their raise

### Positioning Language

**50/50 (Default):**
- Present as the standard engagement structure
- No special framing needed — it's the default

**30/70 Confidence Model:**

*Do say:*
- "We offer a Confidence Model for qualified companies — we put skin in the game alongside you."
- "We're so confident in what we deliver that we'll defer the majority of our fee until your raise closes."
- "This structure aligns our incentives — we succeed when you succeed."
- "The Confidence Model includes a modest premium to reflect the extended payment timeline, but it dramatically reduces your upfront capital commitment."

*Do not say:*
- "Discount" — it's not a discount, it's a different structure with a premium.
- "We'll take a percentage of the raise" — this is a fixed fee, not a success fee.
- "Our costs are low, so we can afford it" — never disclose internal cost structure.
- "We offer financing" — this is a payment structure, not a loan.

**Founder's Bet:**

*Do say:*
- "We believe in what you're building. We'd like to offer you something we reserve for a small number of founders."
- "We're willing to start this engagement at a fraction of the standard cost because we have conviction in your raise."
- "The deferred fee is a fixed amount — you'll know exactly what it is from Day 1. No surprises, no percentage calculations."
- "Think of it this way: you get the full platform for [upfront amount] today, and the balance comes from your raise proceeds."

*Do not say:*
- "2.5% of your raise" — never disclose the formula. Always use the fixed dollar amount.
- "Success fee" — this is a deferred engagement fee, not a success fee.
- "We're betting on you" — this sounds like gambling. Use "conviction" and "belief."
- "This is our cheapest option" — it's not about cost, it's about alignment.
- Any comparison to the other structures that implies a hierarchy or value ranking.

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Why is the 30/70 total higher than 50/50?" | "The Confidence Model includes a small premium that reflects the extended timeline. You're trading a higher total cost for dramatically lower upfront commitment — and you only pay the balance after your raise succeeds." |
| "Can we do 20/80 or 10/90?" | "The 30% upfront is our minimum to begin engagement. It covers our commitment of senior resources to your project from Day 1. We can't start without it." |
| "Can we remove the premium?" | "The premium is part of the Confidence Model structure. For zero-premium pricing, we offer our standard 50/50 structure." |
| "What if our raise takes longer than 12 months?" | "We include a standard 12-month window with the option to extend to 18 months. We want to give you every chance to succeed." |
| "Can we pay from raise proceeds?" | "That's exactly what the Confidence Model is designed for. Your 70% balance is due after your raise closes — funded directly from the capital you've raised." |
| "The Founder's Bet deferred fee seems high." | "The total is a fixed amount that represents a small fraction of the capital you're raising. Compare it to a traditional investment bank that charges 3-6% of your raise as a success fee — this is a fraction of that, and you get a complete infrastructure platform, not just introductions." |
| "Can I get the Founder's Bet at a lower deferred amount?" | "The terms are fixed — that's what makes it simple. The upfront is the lowest we offer anywhere, and the deferred amount reflects the full scope of what we deliver. If the deferred feels too high, the Confidence Model might be a better fit." |

### Conversation Flow

```
1. Present 50/50 pricing
   └── Client agrees → Close on 50/50 ✓

2. Client pushes back on upfront cost
   └── Probe: Is it budget constraints or perceived value?
       ├── Perceived value → Reinforce ROI, case studies, comparable costs
       │   └── Client agrees → Close on 50/50 ✓
       └── Genuine budget constraint → Qualify the deal (Score >= 3.0?)
           ├── Score < 3.0 → Decline or 50/50 only
           └── Score >= 3.0 → Introduce Confidence Model
               └── Present 30/70 terms
                   └── Client agrees → Close on 30/70 ✓

--- SEPARATE PATH (Not part of sales flow) ---

3. Internal nomination for Founder's Bet
   └── Score >= 4.5? Raise >= $10M? Revenue/traction confirmed?
       ├── No → Do not offer. Use standard flow above.
       └── Yes → Present Founder's Bet as an invitation
           └── Client agrees → Close on Founder's Bet ✓
```

### What We Never Disclose

- Internal delivery costs or margin structure
- Cost coverage multiples
- Portfolio cap or active 30/70 / Founder's Bet count
- Qualification scoring criteria or client scores
- Risk-adjusted expected value calculations
- Raise success rate assumptions
- **The 2.5% formula behind the Founder's Bet deferred fee** — always present as a fixed dollar amount

## 12. Appendix: Worked Examples

### Example A: $10M War Chest — 50/50 Standard

**Scenario:** Growth-stage SaaS company raising $10M Series A. Strong team, $2M ARR, clear use of proceeds. No budget constraints.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price | $200,000 |
| Kickoff payment (50%) | $100,000 |
| Delivery payment (50%) | $100,000 |
| **Total collected** | **$200,000** |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $26,500 |
| **Gross profit** | **$173,500** |
| **Gross margin** | **86.8%** |

Timeline: Kickoff Day 0, delivery Day 21, fully collected by Day 21.

---

### Example B: $25M Full Arsenal — 30/70 Confidence Model (Raise Succeeds)

**Scenario:** Med-tech company raising $25M Series B. Experienced team, $8M revenue, strong investor pipeline. CFO concerned about deploying $225K upfront while also funding clinical trials.

Qualification score: 4.2 / 5.0 (exceeds 3.0 minimum).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price (base) | $450,000 |
| Upfront payment (30%) | $135,000 |
| Deferred base (70%) | $315,000 |
| Premium (12.5%) | $39,375 |
| **Total deferred** | **$354,375** |
| **Grand total** | **$489,375** |

The raise closes in month 8 at $28M (exceeds 50% threshold on day of first close at $14M).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total collected | $489,375 |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $45,000 |
| **Gross profit** | **$444,375** |
| **Gross margin** | **90.8%** |

---

### Example C: $5M Launch Pad — 30/70 Confidence Model (Raise Fails)

**Scenario:** Consumer wellness startup raising $5M seed round. First-time founder, compelling product, early traction. Score: 3.5 (meets $5M minimum).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Deal price (base) | $75,000 |
| Upfront payment (30%) | $22,500 |
| Deferred (70% + 15% premium) | $60,375 |
| **Grand total (if raise succeeds)** | **$82,875** |

The raise stalls. After 12 months, the client has raised $1.8M (below the $2.5M success threshold). Client requests extension.

**Month 12-18 (Extension):**
- +5% escalation on $60,375 = $3,019 additional
- New deferred total: $63,394

At month 18 (hard cap), the raise has reached $2.2M. Still below threshold, but the hard cap triggers payment obligation.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $22,500 |
| Deferred collected (hard cap enforcement) | $63,394 |
| **Total collected** | **$85,894** |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $11,500 |
| **Gross profit** | **$74,394** |

> **Note:** Hard cap collection requires enforcement. In practice, a client who failed to raise may have limited ability to pay. The contractual right to collect is clear, but actual recovery may involve negotiation, payment plans, or partial write-off. This is why the $5M tier requires the highest qualification score.

---

### Example D: $50M Full Arsenal+ — 30/70 with Acquisition Clawback

**Scenario:** Health-tech platform raising $50M. During month 6, before the raise closes, the company receives and accepts a $120M acquisition offer.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $180,000 |
| Deferred owed (clawback triggered) | $462,000 |
| **Total collected** | **$642,000** |

The acquisition clawback provision triggers immediate payment from transaction proceeds. The company pays $462,000 from the $120M acquisition — a trivial 0.39% of proceeds.

---

### Example E: Portfolio Scenario — 5 Active 30/70 Engagements

**Scenario:** Maximum portfolio at cap.

| # | Raise | Upfront Collected | Deferred Outstanding | Est. Success Rate |
|---|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $10M | $60,000 | $157,500 | 60% |
| 2 | $25M | $135,000 | $354,375 | 65% |
| 3 | $25M | $135,000 | $354,375 | 65% |
| 4 | $50M | $180,000 | $462,000 | 70% |
| 5 | $100M+ | $225,000 | $577,500 | 75% |
| **Total** | | **$735,000** | **$1,905,750** | |

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total upfront collected | $735,000 |
| Total delivery costs (est.) | $249,000 |
| **Upfront profit (guaranteed)** | **$486,000** |
| Expected deferred collection (probability-weighted) | $1,311,713 |
| **Expected total portfolio revenue** | **$2,046,713** |
| **Expected total portfolio profit** | **$1,797,713** |

Worst case (all raises fail): $486,000 profit on $735,000 collected. The business remains profitable even in catastrophic market conditions.

---

### Example F: $25M Full Arsenal — Founder's Bet (Raise Succeeds)

**Scenario:** AI infrastructure company raising $25M Series B. Repeat founder (previous exit at $80M), $6M ARR growing 3x YoY, 4 institutional VCs in active diligence. CTO previously built infrastructure at a FAANG company.

Qualification score: 4.8 / 5.0. Senior team member nominates with written conviction thesis.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Base deal price | $450,000 |
| Upfront payment (15%) | $67,500 |
| Deferred fee (fixed) | $625,000 |
| **Grand total** | **$692,500** |

The raise closes in month 5 at $30M (oversubscribed).

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Total collected | $692,500 |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $45,000 |
| **Gross profit** | **$647,500** |
| **Gross margin** | **93.5%** |

Compared to 50/50 on the same deal: $405,000 gross profit. The Founder's Bet generated **$242,500 additional profit** (+59.9%) by accepting $157,500 less upfront and waiting 5 months.

---

### Example G: $50M Full Arsenal+ — Founder's Bet (Raise Fails)

**Scenario:** Climate-tech company raising $50M. Strong score (4.6) and internal nomination. Market conditions shift — interest rates spike, climate-tech funding contracts.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $90,000 |
| Deferred owed | $1,250,000 |
| **Grand total (if raise had succeeded)** | **$1,340,000** |

The raise stalls at $18M after 12 months (below $25M threshold). Client requests extension.

**Month 12-18 (Extension):**
- +5% escalation on $1,250,000 = $62,500 additional
- New deferred total: $1,312,500

At month 18 (hard cap), the raise has reached $22M. Still below threshold. Hard cap triggers.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $90,000 |
| Deferred contractually owed (hard cap) | $1,312,500 |
| Internal delivery cost (est.) | $57,500 |
| **Upfront profit (guaranteed)** | **$32,500** |

> **Note:** Hard cap enforcement on a $1.3M deferred amount from a company that failed to raise $50M is significantly more difficult than enforcing a $462K 30/70 deferred. The contractual right is clear, but practical recovery will likely involve extended negotiation. The upfront $90,000 covers delivery costs with $32,500 margin — the business does not lose money even if the deferred is never collected. The acquisition clawback provides a secondary recovery mechanism if the company is later acquired.

---

### Example H: Mixed Portfolio — 30/70 + Founder's Bet

**Scenario:** Combined maximum portfolio (5 active 30/70 + 3 active Founder's Bet).

**30/70 Portfolio (from Example E):**

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $735,000 |
| Expected deferred collection | $1,311,713 |
| **Expected total revenue** | **$2,046,713** |

**Founder's Bet Portfolio:**

| # | Raise | Upfront Collected | Deferred Outstanding | Est. Success Rate |
|---|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $10M | $30,000 | $250,000 | 60% |
| 2 | $25M | $67,500 | $625,000 | 65% |
| 3 | $50M | $90,000 | $1,250,000 | 70% |
| **Total** | | **$187,500** | **$2,125,000** | |

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Upfront collected | $187,500 |
| Total delivery costs (est.) | $129,000 |
| **Upfront profit (guaranteed)** | **$58,500** |
| Expected deferred collection | $1,431,250 |
| **Expected total revenue** | **$1,618,750** |
| **Expected total profit** | **$1,489,750** |

**Combined Portfolio:**

| Metric | 30/70 Only | Founder's Bet Only | Combined |
|--------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Upfront collected | $735,000 | $187,500 | $922,500 |
| Delivery costs | $249,000 | $129,000 | $378,000 |
| Guaranteed profit | $486,000 | $58,500 | $544,500 |
| Expected deferred | $1,311,713 | $1,431,250 | $2,742,963 |
| **Expected total profit** | **$1,797,713** | **$1,489,750** | **$3,287,463** |

The combined portfolio generates $3.3M+ in expected profit across 8 active engagements. Worst case (all raises fail): $544,500 guaranteed profit from upfront payments alone.
