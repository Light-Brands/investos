## Raise-Linked Pricing Matrix

### Unified Payment Framework: Every Structure Includes a Raise Kicker

**Date:** February 2026
**Classification:** STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL — Internal Use Only
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared by:** Transformational Epicenter Revenue Operations

---

> **CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE**: This document is strictly internal. It contains the raise-linked pricing formulas behind every payment structure. Client-facing materials show **fixed dollar amounts only** — never percentages of the raise. The kicker is always presented as a "deferred engagement fee," never as a "success fee" or "percentage of the raise."

---

## The Framework

Every payment structure includes two components:

1. **Upfront payment** — a percentage of the base engagement price, paid at contract execution
2. **Raise kicker** — a percentage of the raise target, paid after the raise closes

The less you put down, the higher the kicker. There is always a kicker.

| Structure | Upfront | Kicker | Trade-off |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **15% Down** | 15% of base price | 2.50% of raise | Lowest barrier. Highest total. Invitation only. |
| **30% Down** | 30% of base price | 1.25% of raise | Low barrier. Moderate total. Qualified deals. |
| **50% Down** | 50% of base price | 0.75% of raise | Balanced. Lower total. Standard offer. |
| **100% Down** | 100% of base price | 0.50% of raise | Full upfront. Smallest kicker. Default offer. |

### The Logic

- The **upfront** covers delivery costs and de-risks the engagement
- The **kicker** is 100% margin — it only materializes when the raise closes
- The kicker percentage drops as the upfront increases because we carry less risk
- Even the 100% down structure includes a kicker — we participate in every successful raise

## Revenue Analysis: Kicker as % of Capital Raised

From the client's perspective, what fraction of their raise goes to us?

### Total Engagement Cost as % of Raise

| Raise | 15% Down | 30% Down | 50% Down | 100% Down |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| $5M | 2.73% | 1.70% | 1.50% | 2.00% |
| $10M | 2.80% | 1.85% | 1.75% | 2.50% |
| $25M | 2.77% | 1.79% | 1.65% | 2.30% |
| $50M | 2.68% | 1.61% | 1.35% | 1.70% |
| $100M+ | 2.61% | 1.48% | 1.13% | 1.25% |

> **Context:** Traditional investment banks charge **3-6% success fees** on the raise amount — that's $750K-$1.5M on a $25M raise, for introductions alone. Every structure we offer is below traditional IB pricing, and we deliver a complete infrastructure platform, not just introductions.

### Kicker-Only as % of Raise (What the Client Pays After Close)

| Raise | 15% Down | 30% Down | 50% Down | 100% Down |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| All tiers | 2.50% | 1.25% | 0.75% | 0.50% |

The kicker percentage is constant across raise sizes — the fixed dollar amount scales linearly.

## Internal Economics

### Delivery Cost Coverage (Upfront vs. Cost)

| Raise | Cost (Mid) | 15% Down | 30% Down | 50% Down | 100% Down |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| $5M | $11,500 | 0.98x | 1.96x | 3.26x | 6.52x |
| $10M | $26,500 | 1.13x | 2.26x | 3.77x | 7.55x |
| $25M | $45,000 | 1.50x | 3.00x | 5.00x | 10.00x |
| $50M | $57,500 | 1.57x | 3.13x | 5.22x | 10.43x |
| $100M+ | $75,000 | 1.50x | 3.00x | 5.00x | 10.00x |

### Gross Margin by Structure (Raise Succeeds)

| Raise | 15% Down | 30% Down | 50% Down | 100% Down |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| $5M | 91.6% | 86.5% | 84.7% | 88.5% |
| $10M | 90.5% | 85.7% | 84.9% | 89.4% |
| $25M | 93.5% | 89.9% | 89.1% | 92.2% |
| $50M | 95.7% | 92.9% | 91.5% | 93.2% |
| $100M+ | 97.1% | 94.9% | 93.3% | 94.0% |

### Worst Case: Raise Fails (Upfront Only, No Kicker)

| Raise | Cost (Mid) | 15% Down P/L | 30% Down P/L | 50% Down P/L | 100% Down P/L |
|-------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| $5M | $11,500 | ($250) | $11,000 | $26,000 | $63,500 |
| $10M | $26,500 | $3,500 | $33,500 | $73,500 | $173,500 |
| $25M | $45,000 | $22,500 | $90,000 | $180,000 | $405,000 |
| $50M | $57,500 | $32,500 | $122,500 | $242,500 | $542,500 |
| $100M+ | $75,000 | $37,500 | $150,000 | $300,000 | $675,000 |

Every structure is profitable if the raise fails — **except 15% down at $5M**, which loses $250 at midpoint cost. The 50% and 100% structures generate substantial profit even without the kicker.

### Risk-Adjusted Expected Value (Using Estimated Success Rates)

| Raise | Success Rate | 15% Down EV | 30% Down EV | 50% Down EV | 100% Down EV |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| $5M | 55% | $80,000 | $56,875 | $58,125 | $88,750 |
| $10M | 60% | $180,000 | $135,000 | $145,000 | $230,000 |
| $25M | 65% | $473,750 | $338,125 | $346,875 | $531,250 |
| $50M | 70% | $965,000 | $617,500 | $562,500 | $775,000 |
| $100M+ | 75% | $1,987,500 | $1,162,500 | $937,500 | $1,125,000 |

> **EV formula:** Upfront + (Success Rate x Deferred Kicker)

### EV Comparison: Which Structure Maximizes Per-Deal Revenue?

| Raise | Best EV Structure | EV | Runner-Up | EV |
|-------|-------------------|-----|-----------|-----|
| $5M | 100% Down | $88,750 | 15% Down | $80,000 |
| $10M | 100% Down | $230,000 | 15% Down | $180,000 |
| $25M | 100% Down | $531,250 | 15% Down | $473,750 |
| $50M | 15% Down | $965,000 | 100% Down | $775,000 |
| $100M+ | 15% Down | $1,987,500 | 100% Down | $1,125,000 |

**Key insight:** At $5M-$25M raises, the 100% Down structure has the highest expected value because the upfront alone exceeds the probability-weighted kicker of higher structures. At $50M+, the 15% Down structure dominates because the 2.5% kicker is so large that even discounted by the success rate, it generates more expected revenue than collecting the full base price upfront.

**Strategic read:** Default to 100% Down for maximum risk-adjusted revenue at $5M-$25M. Reserve 15% Down for $50M+ raises where the kicker economics are transformational. The 30% and 50% structures occupy the middle ground — offer when the client needs a lower upfront but the raise isn't large enough for the 15% Down math to dominate.

## Client-Facing Presentation Rules

### What Clients See

For each structure, clients see **fixed dollar amounts only**:

- **Upfront payment:** "$67,500 at contract execution"
- **Deferred fee:** "$312,500 after your raise closes"
- **Total:** "$447,500"

### What Clients Never See

- The kicker percentages (2.50%, 1.25%, 0.75%, 0.50%)
- That the deferred fee is calculated as a percentage of the raise
- Any framing as a "success fee" or "raise percentage"
- Internal cost coverage or margin analysis

### How to Frame Each Structure

| Structure | Client-Facing Name | Positioning |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **15% Down** | Founder's Bet | By invitation. "We believe in you enough to start at a fraction of the cost." |
| **30% Down** | Confidence Model | For qualified companies. "We defer the majority — you pay from raise proceeds." |
| **50% Down** | Standard | Default offer. "Half to start, a deferred engagement fee after your raise closes." |
| **100% Down** | Full Commitment | Lead offer. "Full engagement price upfront, plus a modest deferred fee when your raise succeeds." |

### Objection: "Why do I owe anything after my raise if I paid 100% upfront?"

> "The base engagement price covers the complete platform build and delivery. The deferred fee reflects our ongoing alignment with your fundraising success — it's a fixed amount, agreed upfront, and it's the smallest deferred fee of any structure we offer. Think of it as a success alignment component that ensures our incentives stay connected through your raise."
