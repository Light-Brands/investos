## 1. The Core Problem

We want to collect fees that are linked to the size of a client's capital raise. Our pricing matrix includes a deferred "kicker" at every payment tier:

| Structure | Upfront | Kicker |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 15% Down (Founder's Bet) | 15% of base price | 2.50% of raise |
| 30% Down (Confidence Model) | 30% of base price | 1.25% of raise |
| 50% Down (Standard) | 50% of base price | 0.75% of raise |
| 100% Down (Full Commitment) | 100% of base price | 0.50% of raise |

Under US federal securities law, **transaction-based compensation** — fees tied to the size or outcome of a securities transaction (like a capital raise) — is the single most heavily weighted indicator of broker-dealer activity. Receiving it without being registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and FINRA is illegal.

### What the Law Says

**Section 3(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:** A "broker" is any person "engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others."

**Section 15(a)(1):** Any broker using US interstate commerce to effect securities transactions must register with the SEC.

**The SEC's position is unambiguous:** Transaction-based compensation creates a "salesman's stake" in the offering. It doesn't matter what you call it — "consulting fee," "advisory fee," "deferred engagement fee," or "success fee." If the compensation is mathematically tied to a securities transaction, the SEC treats it as broker-dealer activity.

### What Happens If We Get It Wrong

| Consequence | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Disgorgement** | Return of ALL fees earned + prejudgment interest |
| **Civil penalties** | $20,000-$100,000+ per violation (recent cases) |
| **Injunctions** | Permanent bar from securities transactions |
| **Criminal prosecution** | Possible in willful cases |
| **Client harm** | Investors gain rescission rights (can demand their money back); clients disqualified from future Reg D offerings |

Recent enforcement: January 2025, the SEC charged multiple individuals for acting as unregistered brokers — combined disgorgement $440K+, penalties $100K. In 2024, one firm paid $936K disgorgement + $1.25M civil penalty.

## 2. What We Can and Cannot Do Today

### What We CAN Do (No Registration Required)

| Activity | Why It's OK |
|---|---|
| Charge fixed fees for consulting deliverables | Not securities activity — we're selling documents, models, platforms |
| Set milestone-based payments tied to deliverable handoff | Payment trigger is deliverable completion, not a securities event |
| Charge flat retainers or hourly rates | Not transaction-based compensation |
| Prepare pitch decks, financial models, data rooms | Advisory/consulting services, not effecting securities transactions |
| Build investor platforms and dashboards | Software/design services |
| Provide strategic advice on fundraising approach | General business consulting (as long as we don't solicit investors or negotiate terms) |

### What We CANNOT Do (Registration Required)

| Activity | Why It's Prohibited |
|---|---|
| Charge a stated "X% of your raise" | Textbook transaction-based compensation |
| Collect a deferred fee triggered by the raise closing | Fee tied to outcome of a securities transaction |
| Solicit or contact investors on behalf of the client | Broker-dealer activity (effecting transactions) |
| Negotiate investment terms between issuer and investor | Broker-dealer activity |
| Handle or transmit investor funds or securities | Broker-dealer activity |
| Distribute offering materials to investors | Broker-dealer activity |
| Openly state the deferred fee is a percentage of the raise | Explicitly transaction-based compensation |

### The Grey Zone (Where We Are Now)

| Activity | Risk Level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Charging a fixed dollar amount that was internally calculated as a percentage of the raise | **Moderate** | SEC applies substance-over-form. If emails, internal docs, or simple math reveal the formula, the fee may be treated as transaction-based. But it's meaningfully better than stating the percentage. |
| Conditioning the deferred fee on the raise closing | **High** | Payment contingent on a securities event is a strong indicator of transaction-based compensation, even if the dollar amount is fixed. |
| Charging a deferred fee on a time-based trigger (e.g., 12 months) rather than a raise-closing trigger | **Lower** | Decoupling the payment from the securities event reduces the nexus. But if the amount was calculated based on the raise, residual risk remains. |

---

## 3. Route 1: Fixed-Fee Consulting (Current Model)

### How It Works

We charge fixed, pre-agreed dollar amounts for consulting deliverables. We do not state or disclose that the deferred fee is calculated as a percentage of the raise. Client-facing materials show fixed dollar amounts only.

### Structure

```
Client → Pays fixed consulting fee → Our Firm
         (upfront + deferred amount)

Deferred payment triggered by:
  - Time-based deadline (12 months), OR
  - Raise closing, whichever comes first
```

### What We Can Charge

All four structures (15/30/50/100% down) with deferred amounts presented as fixed fees. The kicker percentages (2.5%, 1.25%, 0.75%, 0.5%) are never disclosed.

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk** | Moderate. The fixed-dollar presentation helps, but the raise-contingent trigger and mathematical relationship to raise size create vulnerability. |
| **SEC enforcement risk** | Low-to-moderate if we maintain strict discipline on never disclosing percentages and never engaging in broker-like activities (no investor contact, no solicitation, no term negotiation). |
| **Discovery risk** | If the SEC ever investigates (complaint, audit, whistleblower), internal documents showing the 2.5% formula would undermine the "fixed fee" positioning. |
| **Mitigation** | Use time-based triggers (not raise-contingent). Keep internal formula documentation minimal and clearly labeled as "scope sizing methodology." Never discuss with clients. |

### Verdict

**Viable in the near term, but not a permanent solution.** Works as long as we stay strictly within consulting activities and the deferred amounts are defensibly tied to deliverable scope rather than raise outcome. Risk increases with scale — more deals = more exposure = higher chance of scrutiny.

## 4. Route 2: BD Partnership — Chaperoned Structure

### How It Works

We partner with a registered broker-dealer. The BD is the entity of record for the raise-linked fee. Our firm handles consulting deliverables under a separate agreement. The BD collects the kicker, keeps its cut, and pays us for consulting services.

### Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

### Critical Rule: The Flow of Money

**This works:**
```
Client pays BD → BD keeps 10% → BD pays our firm 90% for services
```

**This does NOT work:**
```
Client pays our firm → Our firm keeps 90% → Our firm pays BD 10%
```

Under **FINRA Rule 2040**, a BD cannot share transaction-based compensation with an unregistered entity. The fee must flow **through** the BD first. The BD then pays us for legitimate consulting services — not as a pass-through of transaction-based compensation.

### What the BD Must Actually Do (Genuine Involvement Required)

The SEC and FINRA will look through any arrangement where the BD is a rubber stamp. The BD must have genuine, substantive involvement:

| BD Activity | Required? | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Review and approve the client engagement | **Yes** | BD must assess suitability and risk |
| Review PPM, subscription docs, offering materials | **Yes** | BD is responsible for compliance of securities documents |
| Supervise any investor-facing communication | **Yes** | BD must oversee or handle directly |
| Maintain books and records per FINRA rules | **Yes** | Required by law |
| Perform KYC/AML checks | **Yes** | BD obligation |
| Review our consulting deliverables | **Recommended** | Ensures materials don't cross into securities advice |
| Have a designated supervisory principal | **Yes** | Must assign a registered principal to oversee |

### Fee Split Economics

Using a 90/10 split (we keep 90%, BD retains 10%):

| Raise | Kicker | BD Retains (10%) | We Receive (90%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **15% Down** | | | |
| $10M | $250,000 | $25,000 | $225,000 |
| $25M | $625,000 | $62,500 | $562,500 |
| $50M | $1,250,000 | $125,000 | $1,125,000 |
| $100M+ | $2,500,000 | $250,000 | $2,250,000 |
| **30% Down** | | | |
| $10M | $125,000 | $12,500 | $112,500 |
| $25M | $312,500 | $31,250 | $281,250 |
| $50M | $625,000 | $62,500 | $562,500 |
| $100M+ | $1,250,000 | $125,000 | $1,125,000 |
| **50% Down** | | | |
| $10M | $75,000 | $7,500 | $67,500 |
| $25M | $187,500 | $18,750 | $168,750 |
| $50M | $375,000 | $37,500 | $337,500 |
| $100M+ | $750,000 | $75,000 | $675,000 |
| **100% Down** | | | |
| $10M | $50,000 | $5,000 | $45,000 |
| $25M | $125,000 | $12,500 | $112,500 |
| $50M | $250,000 | $25,000 | $225,000 |
| $100M+ | $500,000 | $50,000 | $450,000 |

We also collect the full upfront consulting fee (not through the BD) on top of these amounts.

### Cost of the BD Partnership

| Cost Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| BD's percentage of kicker | 10% of deferred fee |
| Compliance/supervision fees (if any) | $5,000-$25,000/year |
| Per-deal compliance review | $2,000-$10,000 per engagement |
| Ongoing supervisory costs | Built into the 10% |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk** | Low. The BD is the registered entity receiving transaction-based compensation. Our firm receives consulting fees. |
| **SEC enforcement risk** | Low, if the BD has genuine involvement and the two-contract structure is properly documented. |
| **Structural risk** | Moderate. We depend on the BD. If the BD has compliance issues, raises fees, or exits the arrangement, we need a backup plan. |
| **FINRA Rule 2040 risk** | Low, if the fee flows BD → Us (not Us → BD). |

### Verdict

**The most practical near-term path.** Gets us compliant without the cost and time of registering our own BD. The 10% fee to the BD is manageable given the economics of the kicker model. Primary risk is dependency on a third-party BD.

## 5. Route 3: BD Partnership — PSE (Personal Services Entity)

### How It Works

Our principals become **registered representatives** (associated persons) of the BD. They then form a **Personal Services Entity** (an LLC or S-corp) that receives transaction-based compensation without the PSE itself needing to register as a BD. This was enabled by the **SEC PSE No-Action Letter (November 2025)**.

### PSE Requirements (November 2025 No-Action Letter)

The SEC Division of Trading and Markets issued no-action relief allowing PSEs to receive transaction-based compensation under these conditions:

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Ownership** | PSE must be wholly owned by registered representatives of the BD |
| **No independent solicitation** | The PSE cannot independently solicit or effect securities transactions — all activity flows through the BD |
| **BD supervision** | The BD must supervise all securities-related activities of the registered reps |
| **Entity type** | LLC or S-corp (not a C-corp) |
| **Compensation flow** | BD pays PSE; PSE does not independently collect from clients |
| **Books and records** | BD maintains all required records |
| **Compliance** | PSE activities are subject to the BD's compliance policies |

### What Our Principals Need to Do

| Step | Detail | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **Pass Series 7 (General Securities Representative)** | Required to become a registered rep | 2-4 months study + exam |
| **Pass Series 63 (Uniform Securities Agent State Law)** | Required in most states | 1-2 months study + exam |
| **Register as associated persons of the BD** | Filed through FINRA's Web CRD system | 2-4 weeks processing |
| **Form the PSE** | Create an LLC or S-corp owned by the registered principals | 1-2 weeks |
| **Execute BD supervision agreement** | Formal agreement defining supervisory responsibilities | Negotiated with BD |

### Advantages Over Route 2

| Factor | Route 2 (Chaperoned) | Route 3 (PSE) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who receives the fee?** | The BD collects, then pays us as a consultant | The BD collects, then pays our PSE as transaction-based compensation |
| **Tax treatment** | Our firm receives consulting income | PSE receives transaction-based income (may be treated differently for tax purposes) |
| **Our control** | We depend on the BD to pass through the fee | Our principals are registered — stronger contractual position |
| **Regulatory standing** | We're an unregistered third party | Our principals are registered reps — we're part of the BD's infrastructure |
| **Long-term positioning** | Always dependent on BD relationship | Builds toward potential own-BD registration later |
| **Fee negotiation leverage** | BD controls the fee (they collect first) | Our principals are the revenue generators — stronger leverage on the split |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk** | Very low. SEC explicitly blessed this structure in November 2025. |
| **SEC enforcement risk** | Very low, if PSE conditions are met. |
| **Exam/registration burden** | Moderate. Principals must study for and pass Series 7 + 63. Ongoing CE requirements. |
| **BD dependency** | Still dependent on a BD, but with stronger positioning (registered reps have more leverage and portability). |

### Verdict

**The strongest near-term path with the best long-term positioning.** More upfront investment (exams, registration) than Route 2, but it gives us registered principals, a compliant fee structure, and a foundation to potentially register our own BD later. The November 2025 PSE letter makes this significantly easier than it was before.

## 6. Route 4: Register Our Own Broker-Dealer

### How It Works

We register a new entity as a broker-dealer with the SEC and become a FINRA member firm. This gives us full authority to collect transaction-based compensation, including stated percentages of raises.

### What Registration Requires

| Requirement | Detail | Timeline / Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Form BD filing** | SEC registration application | 4-6 months processing |
| **FINRA membership application (Form NMA)** | New Member Application to FINRA | 6-12 months (often the bottleneck) |
| **Net capital requirement** | Minimum $5,000-$250,000 depending on activities (likely $5,000 for introducing BD) | Ongoing capital requirement |
| **State registrations** | Register in every state where we conduct business | 2-4 months per state |
| **FINRA qualifying exams** | Series 7 (reps), Series 24 (principal/supervisor), Series 63 (state law) | 2-6 months per exam |
| **Written supervisory procedures (WSPs)** | Comprehensive compliance manual | $15,000-$50,000 to develop |
| **Compliance infrastructure** | Chief Compliance Officer, AML officer, compliance systems | $75,000-$200,000/year ongoing |
| **FINRA assessments and fees** | Annual fees, assessment fees, SIPC membership | $10,000-$50,000/year |
| **E&O insurance / fidelity bond** | Required coverage | $10,000-$50,000/year |
| **Ongoing compliance** | Annual audits, FOCUS reports, regulatory filings | $50,000-$150,000/year |
| **Legal / consulting fees** | BD registration attorneys, compliance consultants | $50,000-$150,000 upfront |

### Total Estimated Cost

| Phase | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|
| **Setup (Year 1)** | $150,000 - $400,000 |
| **Annual ongoing** | $150,000 - $400,000 |
| **Time to operational** | 9-18 months from initial filing |

### What Registration Unlocks

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Openly state "X% of raise"** | Full authority to charge transaction-based compensation |
| **Collect fees directly** | No BD partner, no fee split, no dependency |
| **Solicit investors** | Can actively contact and solicit investors for clients |
| **Negotiate terms** | Can participate in structuring and negotiating investment terms |
| **Handle funds** | Can receive, hold, and transmit investor funds (with appropriate net capital) |
| **Distribute offering materials** | Can send PPMs, term sheets, and offering docs to investors |
| **Full credibility** | "SEC-registered broker-dealer" carries weight with institutional clients |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk** | Lowest of any route. Full regulatory compliance. |
| **Financial risk** | High upfront and ongoing cost. Must be justified by revenue. |
| **Operational risk** | Significant compliance burden. Need dedicated compliance staff. |
| **Timeline risk** | 9-18 months to operational. FINRA new member applications can be slow and iterative. |

### When This Makes Sense

The economics justify own-BD registration when the kicker revenue exceeds the annual compliance cost by a meaningful margin:

| Scenario | Annual Kicker Revenue (est.) | BD Cost | Net Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 deals at $25M avg | $2M-$3M+ | $200K-$400K | **$1.6M-$2.6M+** |
| 10 deals at $25M avg | $4M-$6M+ | $200K-$400K | **$3.6M-$5.6M+** |
| 3 deals at $50M avg | $2M-$4M+ | $200K-$400K | **$1.6M-$3.6M+** |

At even moderate deal volume, the economics overwhelmingly justify the compliance cost. The $200K-$400K annual BD cost is a rounding error against millions in kicker revenue — and we keep 100% instead of paying a BD partner 10%.

### Verdict

**The right long-term destination.** Too expensive and slow for immediate implementation, but the revenue potential of the kicker model easily justifies the investment. Start with Route 2 or 3 now, and begin the BD registration process in parallel.

## 7. Route 5: Offshore Entity (Cook Islands IBC)

### How It Works

Incorporate a Cook Islands International Business Company (IBC) as the fee-collecting entity. The IBC contracts with clients and collects raise-linked fees. The theory: the Cook Islands has no securities broker-dealer licensing regime, so the IBC doesn't need one.

### The Reality

**Securities regulation follows the activity and the people, not the entity's domicile.**

| Question | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Where are our principals operating from?** | If in the US → SEC jurisdiction applies regardless of entity domicile |
| **Where are the clients?** | US clients → SEC applies. UK clients → FCA applies. Etc. |
| **Where are the investors?** | US investors in the raise → SEC can assert jurisdiction |

### When the Cook Islands IBC Works

Only in one narrow scenario:

- Principals are genuinely **non-US persons**
- Operating **entirely outside the US**
- Serving **only non-US clients**
- Facilitating raises from **only non-US investors**
- **No US nexus** of any kind

In this scenario:
- No SEC jurisdiction
- No Cook Islands securities license required (none exists)
- Effectively 0% Cook Islands tax (non-resident, foreign-sourced income)
- But still subject to each client jurisdiction's rules (UK FCA, Singapore MAS, etc.)

### When the Cook Islands IBC Fails

If **any** US connection exists:

| US Nexus | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Principals operate from the US | SEC asserts jurisdiction under Dodd-Frank conduct-and-effects test. Rule 15a-6 foreign BD exemption requires NO US presence. |
| Some clients are US companies | Effecting securities transactions for US persons requires registration. |
| Some investors are US persons | Facilitating raises that include US investors triggers registration. |
| Using US interstate commerce (email, phone, internet) directed at US persons | Jurisdictional trigger under Section 15(a)(1). |

The SEC applies **substance-over-form**. Using an offshore entity to avoid registration while operating from the US is treated as evasion, not legitimate planning — and may be an **aggravating factor** in enforcement.

### Cook Islands Specifics

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Securities licensing** | None required — the Cook Islands FSC only licenses banks, insurers, and trustee companies |
| **Tax** | Non-resident IBC: 28% on Cook Islands-sourced income only (effectively 0% on foreign consulting fees) |
| **Privacy** | No public IBC registry; no public beneficial ownership register |
| **Asset protection** | Among the strongest globally |
| **FATCA/CRS** | Fully participates in automatic information exchange — US beneficial owners will be reported to the IRS |
| **EU/FATF status** | Fully delisted from EU blacklist/greylist; FATF compliant (38/40 recommendations) |
| **No regulatory credibility** | No securities license available → cannot point to "home jurisdiction regulation" to satisfy other regulators |
| **Post-2019 tax reform** | Blanket tax exemption eliminated; less advantageous than pre-2019 |

### Per-Jurisdiction Analysis (If IBC Serves Worldwide Clients)

| Client Jurisdiction | Regulator | Registration Needed? | Exemption for Cook Islands IBC? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **US** | SEC/FINRA | Yes | Rule 15a-6 only if NO US presence |
| **UK** | FCA | Yes | Overseas Persons Exclusion (does NOT require home regulation) |
| **EU** | National regulators | Varies | MiFIR equivalence not activated for any country |
| **Singapore** | MAS | Yes (CMS licence) | Unsolicited business exemption only |
| **UAE (DIFC/ADGM)** | DFSA/FSRA | Yes | ADGM Remote Members framework |
| **Australia** | ASIC | Yes (AFS licence) | Foreign AFSL requires "comparable regulator" status — Cook Islands doesn't qualify |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk (US-touching)** | Very high. The IBC provides no protection from SEC jurisdiction if principals are in the US or clients/investors are US persons. |
| **Legal risk (non-US only)** | Low for Cook Islands; moderate for other client jurisdictions. |
| **Reputational risk** | Moderate. "Cook Islands IBC" may raise eyebrows with sophisticated clients and institutional investors. |
| **Structural risk** | Using an offshore entity specifically to avoid securities registration could be viewed as evasion. |

### Verdict

**Not a solution for US-touching activity. Viable only for a genuinely non-US operation.** The Cook Islands IBC is primarily an asset protection and privacy vehicle, not a securities regulatory solution. If we operate from the US, serve US clients, or facilitate raises with US investors, the IBC changes nothing about the SEC analysis.

If we eventually have a significant non-US client base with non-US raises, a Cook Islands IBC (or more likely a Singapore, DIFC, or UK entity) could serve as the contracting entity for that international book of business. But it doesn't solve the core US problem.

## 8. Route 6: Wait for SEC Finder's Exemption

### Status

The SEC under Chairman Paul Atkins is actively revisiting a finder's exemption:

| Event | Date | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Original proposal** | October 2020 | SEC voted 3-2 to propose a conditional exemption for finders. Two tiers: Tier I (provide names only) and Tier II (broader solicitation with disclosure). |
| **Comment period closed** | November 2020 | Never finalized. Lapsed under subsequent SEC leadership. |
| **Revival** | July 2025 | SEC Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee revisited the issue. Chairman Atkins and Commissioner Peirce signaled strong support. |
| **Expected action** | 2026 (speculative) | May use exemptive order (faster) rather than formal rulemaking. Likely broader than 2020 proposal. |
| **Current status** | February 2026 | **No exemption has been adopted.** Anyone acting as a finder today operates without federal exemption. |

### What the Exemption Might Look Like

Based on the 2020 proposal and 2025 commentary:

| Feature | Expected Scope |
|---|---|
| **Eligible persons** | Natural persons only (not entities) — may be expanded |
| **Eligible offerings** | Private placements to accredited investors |
| **Raise size** | Possibly blanket exemption for offerings under $5M; conditions for larger |
| **Permitted activities** | Tier I: Provide investor names/contacts only. Tier II: Broader solicitation, distribute materials, participate in discussions — with disclosure requirements. |
| **Compensation** | Transaction-based compensation permitted for qualifying finders |
| **Limitations** | No handling of funds/securities; no negotiating terms; no ongoing relationship |

### Why We Can't Rely on This

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Not yet adopted** | As of February 2026, there is no exemption to rely on. |
| **Scope may be narrow** | Expected to be limited to natural persons, accredited investors, possibly sub-$5M raises — our deals are $5M-$100M+. |
| **State law still applies** | Even if a federal exemption passes, state BD registration requirements are independent and vary widely. |
| **Political risk** | Administration change could reverse direction. |
| **Timeline uncertainty** | Could be months or years before adoption. |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Legal risk** | High. Operating as a finder without an exemption is operating as an unregistered BD. |
| **Timing risk** | Critical. No guaranteed timeline for adoption. |
| **Scope risk** | The exemption may not cover our activities or deal sizes. |

### Verdict

**Not a viable near-term strategy. Monitor closely but do not rely on.** If a broad exemption passes that covers our deal sizes and entity structure, it could simplify compliance significantly. But we cannot build a business model on a regulation that doesn't exist yet.

## 9. Route Comparison Matrix

### Compliance & Risk

| Factor | Route 1: Fixed Fee | Route 2: BD Chaperone | Route 3: BD + PSE | Route 4: Own BD | Route 5: Offshore | Route 6: Wait |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Legal compliance** | Moderate | High | Very High | Full | Low (US) / Moderate (non-US) | None (no exemption exists) |
| **SEC enforcement risk** | Moderate | Low | Very Low | None | High (US) / Low (non-US) | High |
| **Can openly state % of raise** | No | No (BD can) | No (BD can) | **Yes** | Only non-US | No |
| **Can collect raise-linked fees** | Grey zone | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD → PSE) | **Yes (directly)** | Only non-US | No |
| **Investor solicitation** | No | BD can | BD can (our reps supervised) | **Yes** | Only non-US | No |

### Economics

| Factor | Route 1 | Route 2 | Route 3 | Route 4 | Route 5 | Route 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup cost** | $0 | $5K-$25K | $15K-$50K (incl. exams) | $150K-$400K | $5K-$15K | $0 |
| **Annual cost** | $0 | $10K-$50K + 10% of kicker | $10K-$50K + 10% of kicker | $150K-$400K | $5K-$10K | $0 |
| **% of kicker retained** | 100% (but at risk) | ~90% | ~90% | **100%** | 100% (limited markets) | N/A |
| **Time to operational** | Immediate | 1-3 months | 3-6 months | 9-18 months | 1-2 months | Unknown |

### Strategic Value

| Factor | Route 1 | Route 2 | Route 3 | Route 4 | Route 5 | Route 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scalability** | Low (risk grows with scale) | High | High | **Highest** | Limited to non-US | N/A |
| **Client credibility** | Standard | Enhanced (BD-backed) | Enhanced (BD-backed) | **Maximum** | Varies | N/A |
| **Long-term viability** | Diminishing | Strong | Very Strong | **Permanent** | Limited | Speculative |
| **Builds toward own BD** | No | Somewhat | **Yes** (principals registered) | N/A (already there) | No | No |

## 10. Fee Structure Viability by Route

Can we legally charge each fee structure under each route?

### US Clients

| Fee Structure | Route 1: Fixed Fee | Route 2: BD Chaperone | Route 3: BD + PSE | Route 4: Own BD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed consulting fee (upfront, milestone-based)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Deferred fee, fixed $, time-based trigger** | Yes (lower risk) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Deferred fee, fixed $, raise-closing trigger** | Grey zone | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD) | Yes |
| **Stated "X% of raise"** | **No** | BD can state it | BD can state it | **Yes** |
| **15% Down + 2.5% kicker** | Grey zone (fixed $ only) | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD → PSE) | Yes |
| **30% Down + 1.25% kicker** | Grey zone (fixed $ only) | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD → PSE) | Yes |
| **50% Down + 0.75% kicker** | Grey zone (fixed $ only) | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD → PSE) | Yes |
| **100% Down + 0.5% kicker** | Grey zone (fixed $ only) | Yes (through BD) | Yes (through BD → PSE) | Yes |

### Non-US Clients (via Cook Islands IBC or equivalent)

| Fee Structure | Viability |
|---|---|
| **All structures** | Viable if no US nexus. Subject to each client jurisdiction's rules. UK Overseas Persons Exclusion is most favorable. |

## 11. Recommended Path

### Phase 1: Immediate (Now — Month 3)

**Continue Route 1 + Begin Route 2 negotiations.**

- Maintain current fixed-fee consulting model for active engagements
- Tighten internal discipline: minimize documentation of percentage formulas, use time-based triggers where possible, ensure no broker-like activities
- Begin identifying and negotiating with potential BD partners
- Target: BD partnership agreement signed within 90 days

### Phase 2: Near-Term (Month 3 — Month 6)

**Activate Route 2 (BD Chaperone) + Begin Route 3 preparation.**

- Launch first engagements through the BD chaperoned structure
- Principals begin studying for Series 7 and Series 63 exams
- Establish the two-contract model (consulting agreement + BD advisory agreement)
- Target: First BD-chaperoned deal closed within 6 months

### Phase 3: Mid-Term (Month 6 — Month 12)

**Transition to Route 3 (PSE).**

- Principals pass Series 7 + Series 63
- Register as associated persons of the BD
- Form the PSE entity
- Transition fee collection from BD-chaperone to BD → PSE flow
- Evaluate deal volume and kicker revenue to assess Route 4 viability

### Phase 4: Long-Term (Month 12 — Month 24)

**Evaluate and begin Route 4 (Own BD Registration).**

- If annual kicker revenue exceeds $1M+, begin Form BD filing
- Engage BD registration counsel
- File FINRA New Member Application
- Continue operating through BD + PSE during the 9-18 month registration process
- Target: Own BD operational by Month 24-36

### Phase 5: International Expansion (Parallel)

**Establish appropriate entity for non-US clients.**

- Evaluate jurisdiction: Singapore, DIFC/ADGM, or UK entity (all offer better regulatory infrastructure than Cook Islands)
- UK Overseas Persons Exclusion provides the easiest entry for a foreign entity serving UK clients
- Cook Islands IBC only if asset protection and privacy are the primary objectives, not regulatory positioning
