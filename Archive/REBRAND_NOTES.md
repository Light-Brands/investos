**After:**
- Light Brands Consulting now focuses exclusively on InvestOS
- InvestOS is the sole product offering
- No more four-offer ecosystem or staged approach

4. **Team Training:** Brief team on new positioning (no more offering Clarity/AI OS/Growth separately)
5. **External Communications:** Update LinkedIn, email signatures, bios to reflect InvestOS as sole offering

## Brand Messaging Updates

### Old Positioning
"Light Brands operates a four-offer ecosystem. Every client enters through Offer 1..."

### New Positioning
"Light Brands Consulting delivers InvestOS™ — a complete fundraising operating system..."

### Elevator Pitch (Updated)
"We help founders raising institutional capital by delivering everything they need — strategy, financials, legal architecture, market research, an investor platform, and a data room — in 14-30 days instead of 6-12 months, at a fraction of the traditional cost."
