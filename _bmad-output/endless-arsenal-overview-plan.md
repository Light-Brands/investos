**Prepared for:** Owner Review | **Date:** February 16, 2026 | **Status:** Draft for Alignment

## What We're Building

A unified digital presence and investor experience for Endless Biotech — a science-driven plant biotechnology company building industrial-scale biological infrastructure. We're synthesizing six source folders into a cohesive arsenal that tells one clear story: Endless is becoming the backbone of the global plant supply chain.

## The Source Material & What Each Delivers

### 1. Investor Presentation (Source of Truth) — `endless-overview-strategy-v0.97.pdf`

The deck is the canonical narrative. Everything else orbits it. Key enhancements planned:

- **AI & Robotics Unit Economics** — Transform the static cost-savings data into an interactive experience. A slider/toggle where viewers adjust automation levels and watch unit economics shift in real-time. Tied directly to the Pro Forma scaling model.
- **Revenue Pillar Verticals** — Interactive pillar selector. Users pick and choose verticals (cannabis, forestry, bananas, date palms, medicinal fungi, etc.) to see how the platform applies to each. No single-ask framing — this highlights that Endless is a *platform*, not a single-vertical play.
- **No $1M Ask** — The deck positions the business, not the raise. Each vertical is showcased independently, demonstrating breadth and optionality.

### 2. Webflow Website — `endless-biotech-invest.webflow.zip` + `endless-biotech-site.webflow.zip`

Two Webflow exports (investor site + main site). These carry the storytelling elements that the deck doesn't:

- **Expanded Narrative** — The website tells the human story. Investor testimonials, the team's journey, the Tulsa origin story, the "force to be reckoned with" angle.
- **Accredited Investor Section** — Qualification flow and investor-facing content.
- **Story Synthesis** — We merge the website's storytelling with the deck's business logic. The deck is truth; the website adds color and conviction. Only net-new elements from the website make it into the final materials.
- **Font & Design DNA** — Pull brand fonts and visual language from the Webflow source for consistency across all deliverables.

### 3. Financial Model — `Endless_Pro_Forma` (Google Sheet, 12 tabs)

The financial backbone. 4 revenue pillars across a 5-year projection:

| Pillar | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Plant Propagation | $8.1M | $139.7M | $559.0M |
| Laboratory Services | $172K | $1.1M | $913K |
| Education, Consulting & IP | $148K | $2.2M | $1.9M |
| Research-Driven Revenue | $395K | $5.1M | $8.6M |
| **Total** | **$8.8M** | **$148.1M** | **$570.4M** |

- **Capital Required:** ~$7.1M ($3.6M production CapEx + $1.5M research CapEx + $2M working capital)
- **Net Income Year 1:** $1.5M | **Year 5:** $355.3M
- **Interactive Element:** The Pro Forma's scaling model becomes the engine behind the AI & Robotics toggle in the deck — slide automation up, watch margins expand.

### 4. Business Plan — `Endless AI ChatGPT Summary` (Google Doc)

The master overview. 11 sections covering everything from tissue culture at scale through CRISPR trait optimization to the Eliana medicinal fungi framework. This is the reference document for all content creation — it defines:

- **Core Thesis:** Future plant supply chains originate from centralized, lab-based, genetically controlled starting material.
- **3 Layers of Value:** Clean starting material → Optimized genetics → Medicinal/functional biological inputs.
- **Market Expansion:** Cannabis proving ground → crop-agnostic global platform (bananas, sugarcane, date palms, Paulownia, orchids, medicinal mushrooms).
- **Scaling Roadmap:** 250K–500K plants/month near-term → 5M+/month mid-term → regional mega-labs long-term.
- **Structural Advantage:** Labs and R&D operate independently of cultivation licenses = global scalability without regulatory friction.

### 5. Assets — Brand, Media & Press

**Brand Identity:**
- Figma Brand Guide: `figma.com/design/YEvhBKmEHPsMIaeh4hh8JX/Guidelines`
- Current logo needs evolution toward iconic brand authority — the Apple/Nike standard. Recognizable without the name. This is a dedicated workstream.
- Headshots and facility photos available in Drive.

**News / Press Release Section (5 releases ready to publish):**

| Partner | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| QUEST | Dehumidification technology partnership |
| Grodan | Rockwool growing medium endorsement after R&D validation |
| AROYA | Sensors & software for cultivation management |
| FOHSE (x2) | Strategic lighting partner + cross-marketing initiatives |

These establish credibility through industry partnerships. Each PR features CEO Travis Dahm quotes and positions Endless as the scientific leader that top vendors want to align with.

### 6. Data Room — Legal & Securities (Reg D 506(c))

Relevant documents for the investor experience:

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| PPM V3 (Prior Investor Revisions) | Include |
| Reg D 506(c) Offering Documents Combined | Include |

## The Deliverable Vision

When this arsenal is complete, a prospective investor or partner encounters:

1. **A story** — drawn from the website's human narrative, synthesized with the deck's business logic
2. **An interactive deck** — pillar selectors, AI/robotics cost toggles, scaling visualizations powered by real Pro Forma data
3. **A credibility layer** — press releases, strategic partnerships, team credentials
4. **A brand** — evolved logo and visual identity that commands recognition
5. **A data room** — clean, organized, ready for due diligence
6. **A news section** — press releases positioned as ongoing momentum

## Key Decisions for Owner Review

- [ ] Confirm v0.97 deck is the final source of truth (or is a newer version coming?)
- [ ] Approve the 3 excluded data room exhibits (Ex 4, 6, 7)
- [ ] Logo evolution scope — refresh or full rebrand?
- [ ] Interactive elements — web-based (hosted) or embedded in presentation format?
- [ ] Press releases — publish as-is or update dates/content first?
- [ ] News section — standalone page or integrated into the investor site?
