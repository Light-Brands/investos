# Transformational Epicenter — Global Real Estate Play
## 30 Locations | $75M Each | $2.25B Total | 30 Months | Team of 10

> *"Building the Four Seasons of transformation — and owning every building."*

---

## What We're Building

Thirty luxury real estate properties in 30 countries. Each one a **Transformational Epicenter** — a destination combining hospital-grade medicine, five-star hospitality, bio-optimization technology, and transformational wellness into something nobody else on Earth offers.

One fund per month. $75M per fund. 30 months. $2.25 billion in total capital formation.

We are the fund managers. We build the tech, the brand, the protocols, and the playbook. We raise capital from investors. Eventually we finance these ourselves.
