# Step 3: Value Proposition Development

## STEP GOAL:

Articulate a clear, defensible value proposition that communicates why investors and customers should care, supported by concrete proof points.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - draw out the value story from the user
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Customer Value Exploration

Discuss with the user:
- What is the single most important problem you solve?
- What happens if the problem goes unsolved?
- How does your solution differ from alternatives (including doing nothing)?
- What do customers say about the value they receive?

### 2. Primary Value Proposition

Guide the user to articulate the primary value proposition:
- Who is the target customer?
- What specific value do they receive?
- Why is this uniquely better than alternatives?
- Present using a clear framework (e.g., "For [target], [product] is the [category] that [key benefit] unlike [alternatives] because [differentiator]")

### 3. Value Pillars

Identify 3-5 supporting value pillars:
- Each pillar should represent a distinct dimension of value
- Examples: cost savings, time efficiency, risk reduction, revenue growth, competitive advantage
- Discuss which pillars resonate most with different stakeholder groups (customers vs. investors)

### 4. Proof Points

For each value pillar, establish proof points:
- Quantitative evidence (metrics, case studies, benchmarks)
- Qualitative evidence (testimonials, expert endorsements)
- Market validation (industry trends, analyst reports)
- Identify gaps where proof points are needed

### 5. Synthesize Value Proposition

Present complete value proposition framework:
- **Primary Value Proposition**: The headline statement
- **Value Pillars**: 3-5 supporting pillars
- **Proof Points**: Evidence for each pillar
- **Gaps Identified**: Where more evidence is needed

Ask user to confirm, correct, or expand.

### 6. Save Progress

Append confirmed Value Proposition section to {outputFile}.
Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`

### 7. Present Menu

Display: "Value proposition framework established. Ready to define market positioning."

**[C]** Continue to Market Positioning
**[R]** Revise value proposition
**[MH]** Redisplay menu

Wait for user input. On 'C', read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}
