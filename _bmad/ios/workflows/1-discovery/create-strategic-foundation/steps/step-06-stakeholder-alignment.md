# Step 6: Stakeholder Alignment

## STEP GOAL:

Map all key stakeholders, define tailored messaging for each audience, and identify alignment gaps that could undermine the investment narrative.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - guide stakeholder thinking
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Stakeholder Mapping

Identify and categorize all key stakeholders:
- **Investors**: Angels, VCs, institutional, retail (based on raise strategy)
- **Customers**: Current and target segments
- **Partners**: Strategic, channel, technology partners
- **Team**: Founders, employees, advisors, board members
- **Regulators**: Relevant regulatory bodies
- **Other**: Media, industry analysts, community

For each stakeholder group: What do they care about? What motivates their decisions?

### 2. Key Messages by Audience

For each primary stakeholder group, develop tailored messaging:
- What is the core message for this audience?
- What proof points matter most to them?
- What concerns or objections will they have?
- How does the strategic foundation address their specific needs?

Ensure all messages are consistent with the core positioning but tailored in emphasis.

### 3. Alignment Gap Analysis

Identify areas where messaging or strategy may create conflicts:
- Do investor expectations align with customer promises?
- Are there tensions between growth narrative and operational reality?
- Does the team's internal understanding match external positioning?
- Are there regulatory constraints on certain claims or positioning?

For each gap, discuss potential resolution strategies.
