# Step 5: Executive Summary & Investment Thesis

## STEP GOAL:

Synthesize all prior work into a compelling executive summary and investment thesis that serves as the anchor for all investor-facing materials.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - present drafts for collaborative refinement
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Investment Thesis Construction

Based on all prior steps, draft an investment thesis that answers:
- Why does this company exist? (Vision/Mission)
- What value does it create? (Value Proposition)
- Why now? (Market timing and positioning)
- Why this team? (Founder/team credibility)
- How does it make money? (Business model)
- What is the return potential? (Growth trajectory)

Present draft thesis to user for refinement.

### 2. Key Investment Highlights

Identify and articulate 5-7 key investment highlights:
- Each highlight should be a concise, compelling claim
- Each should be backed by evidence from prior steps
- Prioritize highlights that differentiate from competitive alternatives
- Discuss which highlights resonate most with target investor types

### 3. Risk Factors & Mitigations

Discuss openly:
- What are the top 3-5 risks investors will identify?
- What mitigations are in place or planned for each risk?
- How does the company's positioning reduce certain risks?
- What risks are inherent to the market (and therefore acceptable to investors)?

### 4. Executive Summary Draft

Synthesize into a cohesive executive summary:
- Opening hook (1-2 sentences)
- Problem and opportunity
- Solution and value proposition
- Market positioning and differentiation
- Investment thesis and highlights
- Ask and use of proceeds (if known from raise strategy)

Present for user review and collaborative refinement.
