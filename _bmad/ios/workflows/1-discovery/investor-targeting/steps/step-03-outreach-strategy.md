# Step 3: Outreach Strategy

## STEP GOAL:

Develop a structured outreach strategy including channels, engagement funnel, materials requirements, follow-up cadence, and pipeline tracking methodology.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - guide strategy development through dialogue
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Outreach Channels

Discuss with the user:
- What channels are available for reaching target investors?
  - Warm introductions (existing network, advisors, current investors)
  - Investment platforms (AngelList, SeedInvest, Republic, etc.)
  - Industry events and conferences
  - Direct outreach (LinkedIn, email)
  - Syndicate leads and fund-of-funds
  - Media and PR (publications, podcasts)
- Which channels align with the regulation pathway? (e.g., general solicitation rules)
- What is the user's network strength for each channel?
- Which channels have the highest conversion rates for the investor personas?

### 2. Engagement Funnel Design

Define the investor engagement funnel stages:
- **Awareness**: How investors first learn about the opportunity
- **Interest**: What triggers deeper investigation
- **Evaluation**: The due diligence and assessment phase
- **Commitment**: The decision and terms discussion
- **Close**: Legal execution and capital transfer

For each stage:
- What actions move an investor to the next stage?
- What materials are needed?
- What is the expected conversion rate?
- What is the typical time at each stage?

### 3. Materials Required by Stage

Map required materials to funnel stages:
- **Awareness**: One-pager, elevator pitch, social proof
- **Interest**: Executive summary, pitch deck overview
- **Evaluation**: Full pitch deck, financial model, market research
- **Commitment**: Term sheet, subscription agreement, data room access
- **Close**: Legal documents, wire instructions

Identify which materials exist and which need to be created.

### 4. Follow-Up Cadence

Design the follow-up protocol:
- What is the touch-point frequency at each funnel stage?
- What is the escalation process for stalled conversations?
- How are "not now" responses handled?
- What updates keep pipeline investors warm?

### 5. Pipeline Tracking

Discuss pipeline management:
- How will investor conversations be tracked?
- What CRM or tool will be used?
- What metrics matter (conversion rates, time-to-close, pipeline value)?
- How often will pipeline be reviewed?

### 6. Synthesize Outreach Strategy

Present confirmed:
- **Channels**: Prioritized with expected effectiveness
- **Engagement Funnel**: Stages with conversion expectations
- **Materials Map**: Required materials by stage with status
- **Follow-Up Cadence**: Structured touch-point protocol
- **Pipeline Tracking**: Methodology and metrics

Ask user to confirm, correct, or expand.
