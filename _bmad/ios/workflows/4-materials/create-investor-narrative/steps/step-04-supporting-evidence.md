# Step 4: Supporting Evidence

## STEP GOAL:

Assemble all supporting data points, social proof, competitive differentiation evidence, and risk mitigation evidence that backs every claim in the investment thesis and pitch narrative.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - help organize and strengthen evidence
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Key Metrics & Data Points

For each major claim in the narrative, identify supporting evidence:

**Financial Evidence:**
- Revenue figures and growth rates
- Unit economics data
- Margin profiles
- Cash flow metrics

**Market Evidence:**
- Market size sources and methodology
- Growth rate citations
- Industry analyst quotes or reports
- Comparable company data

**Product Evidence:**
- User/customer metrics
- Engagement or retention data
- NPS or satisfaction scores
- Feature adoption rates

### 2. Social Proof & Validation

Compile external validation:
- Notable customers or clients
- Strategic partnerships
- Press coverage and media mentions
- Awards and recognition
- Advisory board members
- Investor commitments or interest

### 3. Competitive Differentiation Evidence

Document competitive advantages:
- Feature comparison matrices
- Performance benchmarks
- Customer preference data
- IP and technical moat evidence
- Time-to-market advantage data

### 4. Risk Mitigation Evidence

For each identified risk, document mitigation:
- What are the top 5 investor concerns?
- What evidence addresses each concern?
- What contingency plans exist?
- What track record mitigates execution risk?

### 5. Evidence Gap Analysis

Identify where evidence is weak:
- Which claims lack quantitative backing?
- Where is the evidence anecdotal vs. data-driven?
- What additional data could strengthen the narrative?
- Priority actions to fill evidence gaps

### 6. Synthesize Supporting Evidence

Present confirmed:
- **Key Metrics**: Data points supporting each claim
- **Social Proof**: External validation summary
- **Competitive Evidence**: Differentiation proof
- **Risk Mitigation**: Concern-to-evidence mapping
- **Evidence Gaps**: Areas needing strengthening

Ask user to confirm, add, or prioritize evidence gathering.

### 7. Save Progress
