# Step 3: Pitch Structure

## STEP GOAL:

Structure the complete pitch narrative arc, crafting each section from the opening hook through the closing call to action for maximum investor engagement.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - guide narrative structure
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. The Hook (Opening 30 Seconds)

Craft the opening that captures investor attention:
- What is the single most compelling fact or story?
- What creates immediate intellectual curiosity?
- What is the "wow" moment?

Work with the user to develop 2-3 hook options and select the strongest.

### 2. The Problem (Pain Point)

Define the problem narrative:
- What is the specific pain being addressed?
- How big is this pain (quantify the cost)?
- Who feels this pain most acutely?
- What are the current inadequate solutions?

### 3. The Solution (Product/Service)

Articulate the solution narrative:
- How does the product/service solve the problem?
- What is the "aha moment" for users?
- How is this demonstrably better than alternatives?
- What is the simplest way to explain it?

### 4. The Market (Size & Opportunity)

Frame the market opportunity:
- TAM / SAM / SOM framework
- Market growth trajectory
- Beachhead market and expansion path
- Why the market is large enough to support the return thesis

### 5. The Traction (Proof Points)

Sequence the traction evidence:
- What proves product-market fit?
- What are the key growth metrics?
- What milestones have been achieved?
- What social proof exists (customers, partners, press)?

### 6. The Business Model & The Ask

Structure the commercial and investment ask:
- How does the company make money?
- What are unit economics (actual or projected)?
- What is the specific investment ask (amount, terms)?
- What will the capital accomplish?

### 7. Synthesize Pitch Narrative Arc

Present the complete pitch structure:
- **Hook**: Opening statement
- **Problem**: Pain narrative
- **Solution**: Product story
- **Market**: Opportunity framing
- **Traction**: Proof points
- **Business Model**: Commercial model
- **The Ask**: Investment opportunity
- **The Close**: Call to action

Ask user to confirm, reorder, or strengthen the arc.
