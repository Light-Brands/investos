# Step 2: Thesis Development

## STEP GOAL:

Develop the core investment thesis that articulates why this is a compelling investment opportunity, covering market timing, team differentiation, approach uniqueness, and return potential.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - draw out the thesis through dialogue
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Core Thesis Discovery

Engage the user in articulating their investment thesis:
- In one sentence, why should an investor put money into this company?
- What is the single biggest insight that makes this opportunity unique?
- What would need to be true for this investment to return 10x?

### 2. Why Now (Market Timing)

Explore the timing thesis:
- What market shift or trend is creating this opportunity?
- Why couldn't this company have succeeded 5 years ago?
- What happens if investors wait another 12 months?
- Are there regulatory, technology, or behavioral tailwinds?

### 3. Why This Team

Discuss team differentiation:
- What unique founder-market fit exists?
- What relevant experience does the team bring?
- What have team members built before?
- What key hires have been made or planned?

### 4. Why This Approach

Explore the differentiated approach:
- How is this fundamentally different from existing solutions?
- What unfair advantage or moat is being built?
- What proprietary insight drives the strategy?

### 5. Return Thesis

Develop the financial return narrative:
- What are the potential exit paths?
- What comparable exits exist in this space?
- What is the realistic return multiple scenario?
- What is the timeline to liquidity?

### 6. Synthesize Investment Thesis

Present the complete thesis to the user:
- **Core Thesis Statement**: One compelling paragraph
- **Why Now**: Market timing argument
- **Why This Team**: Team differentiation
- **Why This Approach**: Strategic uniqueness
- **Return Thesis**: Path to returns

Ask user to confirm, refine, or strengthen the thesis.
