# Step 3: Visual Identity

## STEP GOAL:

Design the complete visual identity system including logo usage rules, color palette, typography system, photography/imagery guidelines, graphic elements, and layout principles.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

- Whitespace and margin standards
- Page template guidance for investor materials

- **Logo System**: Complete usage rules
