# Step 4: Voice & Tone Guidelines

## STEP GOAL:

Define the brand voice attributes, tone variations by context, writing style guide, terminology glossary, and content guidelines that ensure consistent communication across all touchpoints.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - guide voice and tone decisions
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Brand Voice Attributes

Define 4-5 voice attributes that characterize how the brand communicates:

For each attribute, provide:
- **Definition**: What this attribute means for the brand
- **Do**: Examples of this attribute in practice
- **Don't**: Counter-examples to avoid
- **Scale**: Where on the spectrum (e.g., formal <-> casual, technical <-> accessible)

Common attribute dimensions for investment brands:
- Authoritative vs. Approachable
- Technical vs. Accessible
- Formal vs. Conversational
- Bold vs. Measured
- Innovative vs. Established

### 2. Tone Variations by Context

Define how tone shifts across different contexts while voice stays consistent:

**Investor Communications:**
- Pitch presentations: Confident, compelling, data-backed
- Investor updates: Transparent, structured, forward-looking
- Due diligence responses: Precise, thorough, factual

**Marketing Materials:**
- Website copy: Engaging, clear, benefit-focused
- Social media: Accessible, timely, personality-forward
- Press releases: Professional, newsworthy, quotable

**Internal Communications:**
- Team updates: Direct, inclusive, motivating
- Documentation: Clear, structured, actionable

### 3. Writing Style Guide

Establish writing standards:
- Sentence length and complexity preferences
- Paragraph structure guidelines
- Active vs. passive voice usage
- Numbers and data presentation (spell out vs. numerals)
- Capitalization rules
- Punctuation preferences
- Abbreviation and acronym handling
- Inclusive language guidelines

### 4. Terminology & Glossary

Build the brand's terminology guide:
- Preferred terms vs. avoided terms (e.g., "investors" vs. "shareholders")
- Industry-specific terminology usage
- Product/service naming conventions
- Boilerplate descriptions (company, product, team)
- Legal disclaimer language requirements

### 5. Content Do's and Don'ts

Create clear guardrails:

**Do:**
- Lead with value and benefits
- Use data to support claims
- Maintain transparency about risks
- Write for the audience's sophistication level

**Don't:**
- Use hyperbole or unsupported superlatives
- Make forward-looking statements without disclaimers
- Use jargon without context
- Contradict the investment thesis
