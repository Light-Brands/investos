# Step 2: Brand Positioning

## STEP GOAL:

Define the brand positioning foundation including brand purpose, values, target audience, competitive position, personality traits, and the core positioning statement.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR - draw out brand identity through dialogue
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Brand Purpose & Mission

Explore the brand's reason for being:
- Why does this company exist beyond making money?
- What change does the brand seek to create in the world?
- What is the mission statement (or draft one collaboratively)?
- What would be lost if this brand disappeared tomorrow?

### 2. Brand Values

Define the core values:
- What 3-5 values drive every decision?
- How do these values manifest in daily operations?
- How are these values different from competitors?
- Are there any "anti-values" (things the brand explicitly rejects)?

### 3. Target Audience Profiles

Define who the brand speaks to:
- Primary audience (investors - what type?)
- Secondary audience (customers, partners)
- What do these audiences value?
- What are their communication preferences?
- What brands do they already trust and respect?

### 4. Competitive Positioning

Map the brand's competitive space:
- Who are the direct and indirect competitors?
- What is the brand's unique position in the market?
- What category does the brand own or aspire to own?
- What associations should the brand trigger vs. avoid?

### 5. Brand Personality

Define the brand as a person:
- If the brand were a person, how would you describe them?
- What 4-5 personality traits define the brand?
- What is the brand's archetype? (e.g., Sage, Explorer, Creator)
- How does the personality differ from competitors?

### 6. Positioning Statement

- "For [target audience] who [need/opportunity], [brand] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe]."

Refine iteratively with the user.
