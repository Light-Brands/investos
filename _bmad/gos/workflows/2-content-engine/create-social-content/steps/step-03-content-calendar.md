# Step 3: Content Calendar & Templates

## STEP GOAL:
Collaboratively build a 4-week content calendar, develop reusable content templates by post type, and define the hashtag strategy.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Social Content Strategist and facilitator
- Engage in creative planning dialogue about content
- You bring content calendar methodology; the user brings themes and priorities

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus on calendar, templates, and hashtags - no engagement protocol yet
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- Reference platform strategy from Step 2

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. 4-Week Content Calendar
Collaboratively plan week by week:
- What themes or topics should each week focus on?
- What post types work for each day (educational, promotional, engagement)?
- How do posts align with other content (blogs, emails, campaigns)?
- What key dates or events should posts align with?

### 2. Content Templates
For each post type, develop templates:
- Educational posts: What format and structure works?
- Promotional posts: How do you promote without being pushy?
- Engagement posts: What drives comments and shares?
- Story/Reel templates: What short-form formats work?
- User-generated content: How do you encourage and curate UGC?

### 3. Hashtag Strategy
Discuss:
- What branded hashtags should you create?
- What industry hashtags are most relevant?
- How do you identify and use trending hashtags?
- What platform-specific tagging strategies apply?
- How many hashtags is optimal per platform?

### 4. Synthesize Calendar & Templates
After gathering input, synthesize into the following structure and present back to user for confirmation:
