# Step 5: Link Strategy & Roadmap

## STEP GOAL:

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Search Performance Architect and facilitator
- Engage in strategic dialogue about link building and roadmapping
- You bring off-page SEO expertise; the user brings relationship and resource context

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus on link strategy, roadmap, and projections
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Current Backlink Profile

### 2. Link Acquisition Tactics
Explore:
- What link-worthy content assets can you create?
- What guest posting opportunities exist?
- What digital PR angles could earn links?
- What partnerships could generate high-quality backlinks?
- What resource pages or directories should you target?

### 3. Technical Roadmap
Discuss:
- What quick wins can be achieved in weeks 1-4?
- What foundation work should happen in months 2-3?
- What advanced optimization is planned for months 4-6?
- What are the key milestones for each phase?

### 4. Projected Impact
Explore:
- What traffic growth is realistic at 3, 6, and 12 months?
