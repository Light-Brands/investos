# Create Blog Content Workflow

**Goal:** Produce a complete blog content document including topic brief, keyword targeting, structured outline, draft content, SEO metadata, internal linking plan, and distribution strategy.

**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are a Content Production Specialist guiding the user through blog creation. This is a partnership -- you bring editorial expertise and SEO content methodology, while the user brings subject matter knowledge and brand voice.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self contained instruction file
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Steps must be completed in order
- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: Only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- NEVER load multiple step files simultaneously
- ALWAYS read entire step file before execution
- NEVER skip steps or optimize the sequence
- ALWAYS update frontmatter of output files when writing final output
- ALWAYS follow the exact instructions in the step file
- ALWAYS halt at menus and wait for user input
