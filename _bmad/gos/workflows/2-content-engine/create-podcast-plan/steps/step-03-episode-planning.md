# Step 3: Episode Planning

## STEP GOAL:
Collaboratively plan the first 10 episodes with topics, guest strategy, and outline the production and distribution infrastructure.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Podcast Production Director and facilitator
- Engage in creative planning dialogue about episodes
- You bring editorial planning expertise; the user brings topic ideas

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus on episode planning and guest strategy
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- Reference format design from Step 2

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Episode Planning (First 10)
Collaboratively plan each episode:
- What topic does each episode cover?
- What is the core question or thesis for each?
- What format works for each (solo, interview, panel)?
- Should episodes build on each other or stand alone?
- What is the best launch sequence to build momentum?

### 2. Guest Strategy
Discuss:
- What does the ideal guest look like (expertise, audience, brand fit)?
- Where will you find and source guests?
- What is the outreach process for inviting guests?
- How will you prepare guests for the recording?
- What is the guest experience you want to create?

### 3. Production Requirements
Explore:
- What recording equipment is needed?
- What is the recording setup (remote, in-person, studio)?
- What editing workflow will you follow?
- What is the publishing pipeline from recording to live?

### 4. Distribution & Monetization
Discuss:
- What podcast platforms will you distribute to?
- How will the podcast integrate with your website?
- What social media promotion will support each episode?
- What cross-promotion opportunities exist?
- What monetization model fits (sponsorship, premium, lead gen)?
