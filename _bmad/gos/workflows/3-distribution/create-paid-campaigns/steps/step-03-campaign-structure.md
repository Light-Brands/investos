# Step 3: Campaign Structure

## STEP GOAL:
Design the complete campaign hierarchy -- campaigns, ad sets/ad groups, and ad variations -- organized by platform, objective, and audience.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Campaign Architecture
Engage the user in discussion about:
- How should campaigns be organized? (by objective, product, funnel stage, geography?)
- What naming conventions will be used for campaigns, ad sets, and ads?
- How many campaign tiers are needed (prospecting, retargeting, retention)?
- What campaign objectives map to each tier (awareness, traffic, conversions, catalog sales)?

### 2. Ad Set / Ad Group Design
For each campaign, discuss:
- How should ad sets be segmented? (by audience, placement, creative theme?)
- What is the minimum viable budget per ad set for statistical significance?
- How will audiences be split to avoid overlap?
- What placement strategies will be used (automatic vs. manual)?
- What scheduling rules apply (dayparting, flight dates)?

### 3. Ad Variations
Discuss the ad-level structure:
- How many ad variations per ad set for testing?
- What ad formats per platform (single image, carousel, video, collection, lead form)?
- How will creative rotation be managed?
- What is the testing methodology (A/B vs. multivariate)?

### 4. Funnel Alignment
Map the campaign structure to the conversion funnel:
- Top of funnel: awareness and reach campaigns
- Middle of funnel: consideration and engagement campaigns
- Bottom of funnel: conversion and retargeting campaigns
- Post-purchase: retention and upsell campaigns

### 5. Synthesize
Present the complete campaign structure back to the user as a visual hierarchy. Write the **Campaign Structure** section of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append the Campaign Structure section to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-03-campaign-structure`.
