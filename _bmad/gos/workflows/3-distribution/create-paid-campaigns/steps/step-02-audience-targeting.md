# Step 2: Audience Targeting

## STEP GOAL:
Define detailed audience targeting strategies for each paid platform, including custom audiences, lookalikes, interest-based targeting, and retargeting segments.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Audience Foundation
Engage the user in discussion about:
- Who is the ideal customer profile (ICP)? Demographics, firmographics, psychographics?
- What existing customer data is available for custom audiences (email lists, website visitors, purchasers)?
- What are the key pain points and motivations that drive purchase decisions?
- Are there specific audience exclusions needed (existing customers, competitors, irrelevant segments)?

### 2. Platform-Specific Targeting
For each priority platform identified in Step 1, discuss:

**Google Ads:**
- Search intent keywords and match types
- Display/YouTube audience segments
- Custom intent and in-market audiences
- Remarketing lists (RLSA)

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram):**
- Core audiences (demographics, interests, behaviors)
- Custom audiences (website, CRM, engagement)
- Lookalike audiences (source and percentage)
- Advantage+ audience considerations

**TikTok:**
- Interest and behavior targeting
- Custom audiences and lookalikes
- Creator/hashtag-based targeting
- Spark Ads audience strategy

**Other Platforms (LinkedIn, Programmatic, etc.):**
- Platform-specific targeting capabilities
- Account-based targeting if B2B
- Contextual and intent-based targeting

### 3. Retargeting Strategy
Discuss the retargeting funnel:
- Website visitor segments (by page, time on site, actions)
- Engagement retargeting (video viewers, social engagers)
- Cart/form abandonment sequences
- Retargeting windows and frequency caps

### 4. Synthesize
Present the complete audience targeting strategy back to the user, organized by platform. Write the **Audience Targeting** section of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
