# Step 4: Creative Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Define the creative strategy including ad formats, messaging frameworks, visual direction, and A/B testing plans for each platform.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Creative Direction
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What is the core value proposition to communicate?
- What emotional triggers resonate with the target audience?
- What is the brand's visual identity and tone (reference brand voice docs if available)?
- Are there existing creative assets or does everything need to be produced?
- What are competitor ads doing well (and poorly)?

### 2. Ad Format Strategy
For each platform, discuss:
- Which ad formats will be prioritized and why?
- Static image specs and creative requirements
- Video ad length, style, and production approach
- Carousel/collection ad structure
- Lead form ad design
- Platform-specific formats (Reels, Stories, Shorts, etc.)

### 3. Messaging Framework
Discuss messaging across the funnel:
- Headlines: primary, secondary, and variations
- Body copy: length, tone, key phrases
- CTAs: per funnel stage and objective
- Social proof elements (testimonials, stats, logos)
- Urgency and scarcity levers

### 4. A/B Testing Plan
Design the creative testing roadmap:
- What variables will be tested (headline, image, CTA, format, landing page)?
- What is the testing priority order?
- What sample size and confidence level is required?
- How long will each test run?
- What is the process for declaring winners and iterating?
- Creative fatigue signals and refresh cadence

### 5. Synthesize
Present the complete creative strategy back to the user. Write the **Creative Strategy** section of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append the Creative Strategy section to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-04-creative-strategy`.
