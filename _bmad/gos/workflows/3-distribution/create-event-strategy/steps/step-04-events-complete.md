# Step 4: Events Complete

## STEP GOAL:
Review the complete event strategy document, ensure all sections are cohesive, and produce the final deliverable.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Final Review
Present the complete event strategy document for holistic review:

Ask the user to review for:
- Realistic event cadence given team capacity
- Budget alignment with expected ROI
- Consistency in quality standards across event types
- Alignment with broader marketing calendar
- Any gaps or missing elements

### 2. First Event Planning
Facilitate a discussion about:
- Which event should be first?
- What is the timeline for the first event?
- What needs to be set up before the first event (tools, landing pages, email sequences)?
- Who is responsible for each production element?

### 3. Save Final Document
Update `{outputFile}`:
- Set `status: complete` in frontmatter
- Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-04-events-complete`
- Ensure all sections are populated

### 4. Present Completion
Inform the user the event strategy is complete. Suggest next steps:
- Set up event platforms and tools
- Begin production for the first event
- Create registration pages and promotion assets
- Brief speakers and presenters
- Consider running the **launch-campaign** workflow if launching the event series
