# Step 2: Event Planning

## STEP GOAL:
Define the event types, build the event calendar, and create the production playbook.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Event Type Definitions
For each event type, engage the user in discussion about:

**Webinars:**
- What topics and formats (educational, demo, panel, fireside chat)?
- What is the target attendance and conversion goal?
- What is the frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)?
- What platform and tech stack?

**Workshops:**
- What hands-on topics warrant a workshop format?
- What is the ideal group size and duration?
- Virtual, in-person, or hybrid?

**Conferences (Hosted):**
- Is hosting a conference or summit feasible and valuable?
- What would the format, scale, and frequency be?
- What sponsorship or revenue model applies?

**Conference Participation:**
- What industry conferences are must-attend?
- Speaking opportunities vs. booth/sponsorship vs. attendance only?
- What is the conference ROI model?

**Community Events:**
- What informal events build community (meetups, happy hours, AMAs)?
- What frequency and format works for the audience?

### 2. Event Calendar
Build the calendar:
- What is the quarterly event cadence?
- How do events align with product launches, campaigns, and industry cycles?
- What are the key dates and blackout periods?
- How will events be spaced to avoid fatigue?

### 3. Production Playbook
Design the operational framework:
- What is the pre-event checklist (T-minus 4 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week, day-of)?
- What is the day-of rundown structure?
- What technical requirements and backup plans are needed?
- What speaker/presenter guidelines should be established?
- What contingency plans exist for technical failures or low attendance?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the event types, calendar, and production playbook back to the user. Write the **Event Types**, **Event Calendar**, and **Production Playbook** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-02-event-planning`.
