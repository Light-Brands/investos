# Step 3: Promotion Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Design the event promotion strategy, follow-up sequences, and ROI framework.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Promotion Strategy
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What is the promotion timeline for each event type (how far in advance)?
- How will events be promoted across channels (email, social, paid, website, partners)?
- What does the registration page need to include for maximum conversion?
- What is the reminder sequence (confirmation, T-minus 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour)?
- What tactics maximize actual attendance vs. registrations?
- How will speaker/guest promotion amplify reach?
- What role do partners and sponsors play in promotion?

### 2. Follow-Up Sequences
Design post-event engagement:
- What is the attendee follow-up sequence (thank you, recording, resources, CTA)?
- What is the no-show follow-up (recording access, next event, alternative CTA)?
- How will event content be repurposed (blog posts, social clips, podcast episodes)?
- What is the lead handoff process from events to sales?
- How quickly does follow-up need to happen after the event?

### 3. ROI Framework
Define the measurement approach:
- What is the cost model per event type (platform, promotion, production, time)?
- How will revenue be attributed to events (direct conversions, pipeline influence)?
- What are the key metrics per event type (registrations, attendance rate, engagement, conversions)?
- What does the post-event reporting template include?
- How will learnings feed into continuous improvement?
- What is the minimum ROI threshold for continuing each event type?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the promotion strategy, follow-up sequences, and ROI framework back to the user. Write the **Promotion Strategy**, **Follow-Up Sequences**, and **ROI Framework** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-03-promotion-strategy`.
