# Step 3: Media Targeting

## STEP GOAL:
Build a tiered media list with target publications and journalists, and assemble the media kit components.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Media Tier Strategy
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What are the dream publications for coverage (Tier 1)?
- What industry-specific and trade publications matter (Tier 2)?
- What blogs, newsletters, and niche outlets have audience overlap (Tier 3)?
- What podcasts and broadcast media should be targeted?
- Are there specific journalists who have covered similar stories?
- What media monitoring reveals about where competitors get covered?

### 2. Journalist Profiling
For key targets, discuss:
- What beat does each journalist cover?
- What have they written recently that aligns with the story?
- What is their preferred contact method and pitch style?
- What exclusive or angle would appeal to each journalist specifically?
- Are there existing relationships to leverage?

### 3. Media Kit Assembly
Discuss what belongs in the media kit:
- Company fact sheet (key stats, milestones, founding story)
- Founder and spokesperson bios with headshots
- Product screenshots, lifestyle images, and video assets
- Logo files in various formats
- Customer testimonials and case study summaries
- Data visualizations and infographics
- Previous press coverage highlights

### 4. Synthesize
