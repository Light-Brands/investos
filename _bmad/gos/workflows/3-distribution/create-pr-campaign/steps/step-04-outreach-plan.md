# Step 4: Outreach Plan

## STEP GOAL:
Design the outreach sequence, timing strategy, and measurement plan for tracking PR campaign impact.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Outreach Sequence
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What is the initial pitch email structure (subject line, hook, value prop, ask)?
- How should pitches be personalized per journalist tier?
- What is the follow-up cadence (how many follow-ups, timing)?
- When should exclusives be offered and to whom?
- What is the embargo strategy if applicable?
- How will inbound media inquiries be handled?

### 2. Timing Strategy
Discuss campaign timing:
- What is the ideal day/time to send initial pitches?
- How far in advance should outreach begin before the announcement?
- What is the phased rollout plan (exclusives first, then broad outreach)?
- Are there any dates to avoid (holidays, competitor announcements, major news events)?
- How does the PR timeline coordinate with other marketing channels?

### 3. Measurement Plan
Design the PR metrics framework:
- How will media coverage be tracked (monitoring tools, clip services)?
- What share of voice metrics will be measured against competitors?
- How will message pull-through be assessed (did coverage include key messages)?
- What business impact metrics will be attributed to PR (website traffic, leads, brand searches)?
- What is the reporting cadence and format?
- How will PR ROI be calculated?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the outreach plan and measurement framework back to the user. Write the **Outreach Sequence** and **Measurement Plan** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
