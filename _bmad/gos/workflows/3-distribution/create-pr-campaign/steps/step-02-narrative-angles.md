# Step 2: Narrative Angles

## STEP GOAL:
Develop compelling narrative angles, press release drafts, and interview preparation materials.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Primary Narrative
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What is the single most compelling story to tell?
- Why should a journalist care about this story right now?
- What is the human element or founder story behind the announcement?
- What data or proof points make this story credible?
- How does this story connect to broader industry trends?

### 2. Supporting Angles
Discuss secondary story angles:
- What industry trend angle can this story ride?
- What contrarian or surprising angle exists?
- What data-driven story can be extracted?
- What local or regional angles apply?
- What seasonal or timely hooks can be leveraged?
- What customer success stories support the narrative?

### 3. Press Release Drafts
Facilitate press release creation:
- What is the headline and sub-headline?
- What are the key facts in the lead paragraph (who, what, when, where, why)?
- What quotes from leadership and customers should be included?
- What supporting data and context belongs in the body?
- What is the company boilerplate?

### 4. Interview Prep
Build spokesperson readiness:
- What are the 3-5 key messages to deliver in any interview?
- What tough questions should be anticipated?
- What are the bridging phrases to redirect difficult questions?
- What anecdotes and examples bring messages to life?
- What topics are off-limits?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the narratives, press release drafts, and interview prep back to the user. Write the **Key Narratives & Angles**, **Press Release Drafts**, and **Interview Prep** sections of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
