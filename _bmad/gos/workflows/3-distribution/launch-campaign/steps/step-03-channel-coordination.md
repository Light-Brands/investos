# Step 3: Channel Coordination

## STEP GOAL:
Design the channel coordination matrix that orchestrates all marketing channels for a synchronized launch.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Channel Inventory
Engage the user in discussion about each active channel:

**Email:**
- What email sequences will fire at launch (announcement, drip, segment-specific)?
- What is the send schedule and segmentation?
- Who owns email execution?

**Social Media:**
- What platforms will be activated?
- What is the posting schedule on launch day and launch week?
- What organic vs. paid social is planned?
- Who owns social execution?

**Paid Advertising:**
- What campaigns go live at launch?
- What is the budget allocation for launch period?
- What is the ramp-up schedule?
- Who owns paid execution?

**PR and Media:**
- What press outreach is timed with launch?
- Are there embargoed stories lifting on launch day?
- Who owns media relations?

**Website and Landing Pages:**
- What website updates go live at launch?
- What landing pages are being published?
- Who owns web updates?

**Partners and Affiliates:**
- How will partners be notified and activated?
- What partner-specific promotions are planned?
- Who owns partner communication?

**Sales Team:**
- What sales enablement materials are ready?
- How will inbound leads be handled during launch?
- Who owns sales coordination?

### 2. Coordination Matrix
Build the matrix:
- Map each channel to specific actions, timing, and owners
- Identify dependencies between channels (e.g., PR embargo lifts before social posts)
- Identify potential conflicts or resource bottlenecks
- Define the communication protocol between channel owners on launch day

### 3. Synthesize
Present the channel coordination matrix back to the user. Write the **Channel Coordination Matrix** section of the output document.

### 4. Save Progress
Append the Channel Coordination Matrix section to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-03-channel-coordination`.

### 5. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Launch Execution | **[R]** Revise Channel Coordination | **[MH]** Menu Help
