# Step 4: Launch Execution

## STEP GOAL:
Create the detailed hour-by-hour launch day timeline with specific actions, owners, and contingency triggers.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Pre-Launch Day (Day Before)
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What final checks happen the day before launch?
- What needs to be staged and ready to go (scheduled posts, queued emails, paused campaigns)?
- What is the team sync meeting agenda?
- What is the communication channel for launch day (Slack, War Room, etc.)?
- What are the go/no-go criteria?

### 2. Launch Morning
Build the hour-by-hour timeline:
- What is the first action and exact time?
- When does the website update go live?
- When do emails send?
- When do social posts publish?
- When do paid campaigns activate?
- When does the PR embargo lift?
- What are the first checkpoints and metrics to watch?

### 3. Launch Midday and Afternoon
Continue the timeline:
- What is the midday performance check?
- What adjustments might be needed based on morning data?
- What additional content or posts go out?
- What is the team sync schedule throughout the day?
- When does sales begin outreach to hot leads?

### 4. Launch Evening and Day 1 Close
Finish the timeline:
- What are the end-of-day actions?
- What is the Day 1 performance review process?
- What metrics define a successful Day 1?
- What is the team debrief format?
- What decisions need to be made before Day 2?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the complete launch day timeline back to the user. Write the **Launch Day Timeline** section of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append the Launch Day Timeline section to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-04-launch-execution`.

### 7. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Post-Launch Monitoring | **[R]** Revise Launch Execution | **[MH]** Menu Help
