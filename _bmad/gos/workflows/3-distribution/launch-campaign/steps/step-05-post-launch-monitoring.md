# Step 5: Post-Launch Monitoring

## STEP GOAL:
Design the post-launch monitoring plan for the first 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days, plus contingency plans for various scenarios.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. First 24 Hours
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What metrics need to be monitored in real-time (traffic, signups, purchases, errors)?
- What are the alert thresholds (traffic spike, conversion drop, error rate)?
- Who is monitoring what and what is the escalation path?
- What optimization decisions can be made within 24 hours?
- What is the 24-hour recap format and distribution?

### 2. First 72 Hours
Discuss the 72-hour monitoring plan:
- What trends should be emerging by 72 hours?
- What channel-level performance reviews happen?
- What budget reallocation decisions should be made?
- What creative or messaging changes are indicated?
- What customer feedback is being collected and how?

### 3. First 7 Days
Discuss the week 1 monitoring plan:
- What is the daily check-in cadence winding down to?
- What week 1 performance report includes?
- What optimizations should be implemented?
- How does the launch transition to ongoing operations?
- What is the week 2-4 optimization plan?

### 4. Contingency Plans
Design responses to failure scenarios:
- **Technical failures:** Site goes down, forms break, tracking fails -- what is the response?
- **Underperformance:** Traffic or conversion significantly below targets -- what adjustments?
- **Negative feedback/PR:** Bad press, social media backlash, product issues -- who responds and how?
- **Budget overspend:** CPA spikes, overspending on certain channels -- what are the cut triggers?
- **Competitive response:** Competitor launches counter-campaign -- how to adapt?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the monitoring plan and contingency plans back to the user. Write the **Post-Launch Monitoring Plan** and **Contingency Plans** sections of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append both sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-05-post-launch-monitoring`.

### 7. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Finalization | **[R]** Revise Post-Launch Monitoring | **[MH]** Menu Help
