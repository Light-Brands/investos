# Step 3: Organic Growth Plan

## STEP GOAL:
Define organic growth tactics, hashtag strategy, cross-platform amplification, and influencer collaboration approach.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Organic Growth Tactics
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What content formats have the highest organic reach potential on each platform?
- What hashtag strategy will maximize discoverability?
- How will cross-platform amplification work (repurposing content across platforms)?
- What SEO and discoverability tactics apply (YouTube SEO, Instagram SEO, LinkedIn articles)?
- What collaboration opportunities exist (duets, stitches, co-lives, guest posts)?
- What virality mechanics can be leveraged (trends, challenges, memes)?
- What community-driven growth tactics will be used (UGC campaigns, contests, referral programs)?

### 2. Influencer Collaboration
Discuss the influencer strategy:
- What influencer tiers are relevant (nano, micro, macro, mega)?
- What criteria define an ideal influencer partner (audience overlap, engagement rate, brand alignment)?
- What outreach strategy will be used?
- What partnership models fit (gifting, affiliate, sponsored, co-creation, ambassador)?
- What is the budget allocation for influencer partnerships?
- How will influencer content be repurposed?
- What metrics will measure influencer ROI?

### 3. User-Generated Content
Discuss UGC strategy:
- How will UGC be encouraged and incentivized?
- What is the process for curating and republishing UGC?
- What legal/permission framework is needed?
- How will UGC be integrated into paid campaigns?
