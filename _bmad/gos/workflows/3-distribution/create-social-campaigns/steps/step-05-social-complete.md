# Step 5: Social Campaigns Complete

## STEP GOAL:
Review the complete social campaigns document, ensure all sections are cohesive, and produce the final deliverable.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Holistic Review
Present the complete social campaigns document for review:
- Community Vision
- Platform-by-Platform Strategy
- Organic Growth Tactics
- Engagement Framework
- Content Mix
- Influencer Collaboration
- Community Management SOPs
- Growth Metrics

Ask the user to review for:
- Consistency across platforms
- Realistic resource requirements
- Alignment with business goals
- Any gaps or missing elements

### 2. Cross-Platform Coherence Check
Facilitate a discussion about:
- Does the strategy tell a consistent brand story across platforms?
- Are the content pillars properly adapted for each platform?
- Is the team capacity aligned with the posting cadence?
- Are there dependencies between platforms that need coordination?

### 3. Implementation Priorities
Discuss with the user:
- What is the launch order for platforms (all at once or phased)?
- What are the first 30 days going to look like?
- What quick wins can be achieved in week 1?
- What is the escalation path if results are below expectations?

### 4. Save Final Document
Update `{outputFile}`:
- Set `status: complete` in frontmatter
- Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-05-social-complete`
- Ensure all sections are populated

### 5. Present Completion
Inform the user the social campaigns plan is complete. Suggest next steps:
- Begin content production for priority platforms
- Set up social management tools and scheduling
- Initiate influencer outreach
- Consider running the **create-social-content** workflow for detailed content creation
- Consider the **launch-campaign** workflow for coordinated launch
