# Step 2: Community Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Define a detailed platform-by-platform social media strategy and the content mix framework including pillars, ratios, and posting cadence.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Platform Strategy
For each priority platform, engage the user in discussion about:
- What is the specific goal for this platform?
- Who is the target audience on this platform (demographics, behaviors)?
- What content formats perform best here?
- What is the posting frequency and optimal timing?
- What is the growth strategy specific to this platform's algorithm?
- How does this platform fit into the broader social ecosystem?

### 2. Content Pillars
Discuss the content mix:
- What are the 3-5 core content pillars (educational, entertaining, inspiring, promotional, community)?
- What is the ideal ratio of content types (e.g., 40% educational, 30% entertaining, 20% community, 10% promotional)?
- How do content pillars map to business objectives?
- What content themes or series can create recurring engagement?

### 3. Content Calendar Framework
Discuss the operational structure:
- What is the posting cadence per platform?
- How will content be batched and scheduled?
- What tools will be used for scheduling and management?
- How will real-time/trending content be handled alongside planned content?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the platform strategies and content mix back to the user. Write the **Platform-by-Platform Strategy** and **Content Mix** sections of the output document.
