# Step 4: Engagement Framework

## STEP GOAL:
Define the engagement framework including response times, tone guidelines, escalation protocols, and community management SOPs.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Engagement Standards
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What are the target response times for comments, DMs, and mentions?
- How should response times differ by platform and message type (question, complaint, praise, sales inquiry)?
- What is the tone and voice for community interactions vs. content posts?
- How should the brand handle negative comments, trolls, and criticism?
- What constitutes a crisis and what is the escalation path?

### 2. Community Management SOPs
Discuss the operational playbook:
- What does the daily community management routine look like?
- How are comments and DMs triaged and prioritized?
- What are the moderation guidelines (what gets hidden, deleted, banned)?
- How is user-generated content identified and processed?
- What community events or rituals build belonging (weekly threads, AMAs, challenges)?
- What tools will support community management (social listening, inbox management)?

### 3. Crisis Communication
Discuss crisis preparedness:
- What scenarios qualify as a social media crisis?
- What is the immediate response protocol?
- Who are the decision-makers and escalation contacts?
- What are the pre-approved holding statements?
- How will the team coordinate during a crisis?

### 4. Growth Metrics
Define the measurement framework:
- What are the primary KPIs per platform (follower growth rate, engagement rate, reach, impressions)?
- What secondary metrics matter (saves, shares, story replies, link clicks)?
- What is the reporting cadence (daily, weekly, monthly)?
- What growth milestones are the targets (30-day, 90-day, 6-month, 12-month)?
- What tools will be used for analytics and reporting?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the engagement framework, community management SOPs, and growth metrics back to the user. Write the **Engagement Framework**, **Community Management SOPs**, and **Growth Metrics** sections of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
