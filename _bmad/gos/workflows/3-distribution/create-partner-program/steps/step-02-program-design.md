# Step 2: Program Design

## STEP GOAL:
Define the partner types, commission and incentive structures, and program terms.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Partner Type Definitions
Engage the user in discussion about each partner category:

**Affiliate Partners:**
- Who are ideal affiliates (bloggers, content creators, review sites)?
- What is the affiliate value proposition?
- What tracking and attribution method will be used (cookie window, last-click, multi-touch)?

**Referral Partners:**
- How does the referral program work (customer-to-customer, partner-to-customer)?
- What incentives for referrer and referee?
- Is it one-time or recurring?

**Reseller Partners:**
- Will there be resellers or white-label partners?
- What is the reseller margin structure?
- What support and training do resellers need?

**Strategic Partners:**
- What integration or co-marketing partnerships make sense?
- What is the mutual value exchange?
- How formal should these arrangements be?

### 2. Commission & Incentive Structure
Discuss the economics:
- What commission model fits (percentage of sale, flat fee, recurring, hybrid)?
- What are the commission rates by partner type?
- Are there tier structures based on performance (bronze, silver, gold, platinum)?
- What bonus incentives exist (sign-up bonus, volume bonus, accelerators)?
- What are the payment terms (net 30, net 60, minimum threshold)?
- What happens with refunds or chargebacks?

### 3. Program Terms
Discuss the legal and operational framework:
- What are the program rules and restrictions?
- What marketing activities are permitted vs. prohibited?
- What is the cookie duration / attribution window?
- What are the grounds for program removal?
- What exclusivity provisions, if any?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the partner types and commission structure back to the user. Write the **Partner Types** and **Commission / Incentive Structure** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
