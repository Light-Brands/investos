# Step 4: Program Operations

## STEP GOAL:
Define the operational playbook for running the partner program, marketing materials for partners, and success metrics.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Program Operations
Engage the user in discussion about:

- What platform/tool will manage the program (PartnerStack, Impact, Refersion, custom)?
- How will payments be processed (PayPal, bank transfer, gift cards)?
- What is the payment schedule and minimum payout threshold?
- What partner support model will be provided (email, chat, dedicated manager)?
- What is the communication cadence (newsletter, performance updates, new promotions)?
- How often will partner performance be reviewed?
- What are the program compliance monitoring procedures?

### 2. Marketing Materials for Partners
Discuss the partner marketing toolkit:
- What co-branded assets will be provided (banners, email templates, social posts)?
- What swipe files and copy templates will partners receive?
- Will dedicated landing pages be created for partners?
- What promotional calendar will be shared (sales, product launches, seasonal campaigns)?
- How will new marketing materials be distributed to partners?
- What brand guidelines must partners follow?

### 3. Success Metrics
Define the measurement framework:
- What are the program-level KPIs (total partner revenue, number of active partners, average partner value)?
- What are the partner-level metrics (conversions, revenue, conversion rate, activity)?
- What dashboard or reporting tool will be used?
- What is the review cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly)?
- What benchmarks indicate a healthy program?
