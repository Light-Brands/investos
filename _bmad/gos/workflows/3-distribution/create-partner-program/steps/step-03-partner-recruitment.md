# Step 3: Partner Recruitment

## STEP GOAL:
Design the partner recruitment strategy, outreach sequences, and onboarding program.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Ideal Partner Profile
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What makes an ideal partner (audience size, niche relevance, engagement, reputation)?
- What are the minimum requirements for acceptance?
- What are the disqualifying factors?
- How will partner quality be assessed during application?

### 2. Recruitment Channels
Discuss where to find partners:
- Affiliate networks and marketplaces (ShareASale, Impact, PartnerStack)
- Direct outreach to content creators and influencers
- Industry events and conferences
- Existing customer base (turning customers into referrers)
- Competitor partner programs (recruiting their partners)
- LinkedIn and professional communities
- Partner directories and listing sites

### 3. Outreach Sequences
Design the recruitment outreach:
- What is the initial outreach message (value prop for the partner)?
- What is the follow-up cadence?
- How will personalization be handled at scale?
- What collateral accompanies the pitch (program overview, earnings potential)?
- What is the application process (self-serve vs. invitation-only)?

### 4. Partner Onboarding
Design the onboarding experience:
- What does the welcome sequence look like (emails, calls, resources)?
- What training is required before a partner can start promoting?
- Are there certification levels or requirements?
- What does a successful first 30 days look like for a new partner?
- What tools and dashboards will partners access?
- Who is the partner's primary point of contact?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the recruitment and onboarding strategies back to the user. Write the **Recruitment Strategy** and **Partner Onboarding** sections of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append both sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-03-partner-recruitment`.
