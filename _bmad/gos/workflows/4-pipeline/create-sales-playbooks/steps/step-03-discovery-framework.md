# Step 3: Discovery Framework

## STEP GOAL:
Build the discovery call framework with structured questions, qualification criteria, pitch frameworks per persona, and follow-up cadence.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Discovery Questions
Engage the user in discussion about discovery questions by category:

**Situation Questions:**
- What questions establish the prospect's current state?
- What questions reveal their tech stack, team, and processes?

**Problem Questions:**
- What questions uncover pain points and challenges?
- What questions quantify the cost of the current problem?

**Implication Questions:**
- What questions reveal the consequences of not solving the problem?
- What questions expand the scope of impact?

**Need-Payoff Questions:**
- What questions help the prospect articulate the value of solving the problem?
- What questions connect the solution to their specific needs?

### 2. Qualification Criteria
Discuss the qualification framework:
- Which methodology fits (BANT, MEDDIC, CHAMP, or custom)?
- What are the specific qualification criteria for each element?
- What minimum qualification score advances to the next stage?
- What is the disqualification criteria?
- How are qualification notes captured in CRM?

### 3. Discovery Call Structure
Design the call flow:
- How should the call open (rapport building, agenda setting)?
- How should questions be sequenced?
- How long should discovery calls run?
- How should the call close (next steps, commitment)?
- What note-taking standards ensure data quality?

### 4. Pitch Frameworks
For each buyer persona, discuss:
- What value proposition resonates most?
- What is the elevator pitch (30 seconds)?
- What is the full pitch structure (problem, solution, proof, ask)?
- What ROI talking points are most compelling?
- What case studies or proof points map to this persona?

### 5. Follow-Up Cadence
Design the post-meeting follow-up:
- Post-discovery follow-up (timing, content, CTA)
- Post-demo follow-up (timing, content, CTA)
- Post-proposal follow-up (timing, content, CTA)
- Stalled deal re-engagement cadence
- Lost deal follow-up protocol

### 6. Synthesize
Present the discovery framework, pitch frameworks, and follow-up cadence back to the user. Write the **Discovery Framework**, **Pitch Framework**, and **Follow-Up Cadence** sections of the output document.

### 7. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-03-discovery-framework`.
