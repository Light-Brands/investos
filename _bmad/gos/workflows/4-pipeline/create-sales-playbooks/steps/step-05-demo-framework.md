# Step 5: Demo Framework

## STEP GOAL:
Design the product demo script with structure, flow, key moments, and common pitfalls.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Pre-Demo Preparation
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What research should reps do before every demo?
- What discovery insights should inform demo customization?
- What environment/setup is needed (demo account, data, integrations)?
- What technical checks should be completed?
- How should the demo be tailored by persona?

### 2. Demo Opening
Discuss the first 5 minutes:
- How should the demo open (recap discovery, set agenda, confirm priorities)?
- How to establish what success looks like for the prospect?
- How to set expectations for timing and flow?
- What rapport-building is appropriate?

### 3. Core Demo Flow
Design the main demo structure:
- What is the recommended flow (problem > solution > proof > expansion)?
- What features/capabilities should be shown in what order?
- How long should each section take?
- What storytelling framework brings features to life?
- How should the demo be customized based on the prospect's use case?
- Where are the natural pause points for questions?

### 4. Key Wow Moments
Discuss the moments that create emotional impact:
- What are the 2-3 "aha" moments in the demo?
- How should these be set up and delivered?
- What data or personalization makes these moments land?
- How to gauge prospect reaction and adjust?

### 5. Demo Closing and Next Steps
Discuss how to end the demo:
- How to summarize value and tie back to prospect's stated needs?
- What trial close questions should be asked?
- How to establish clear next steps?
- What commitment should be secured before ending?
- How to handle "let us think about it"?

### 6. Common Demo Pitfalls
Discuss what to avoid:
- Feature dumping (showing everything instead of what matters)
- Failing to customize for the audience
- Talking too much, not asking enough
- Technical failures and recovery
- Not closing for next steps

### 7. Synthesize
Present the complete demo framework back to the user. Write the **Demo Script** section of the output document.

### 8. Save Progress
Append the Demo Script section to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-05-demo-framework`.

### 9. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Finalization | **[R]** Revise Demo Framework | **[MH]** Menu Help

On 'C', read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}`
