# Step 2: Buyer Journey Mapping

## STEP GOAL:
Map the complete buyer journey from first awareness through post-purchase, identifying sales touchpoints, buyer actions, and sales actions at each stage.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Awareness Stage
Engage the user in discussion about:
- How do prospects first discover the product/company?
- What are the common entry points (search, referral, event, content, ads)?
- What is the buyer's mindset at this stage?
- What sales actions are appropriate (or is this marketing-only)?
- What information does the buyer need at this stage?

### 2. Consideration Stage
Discuss the evaluation phase:
- What triggers a prospect to actively evaluate solutions?
- What alternatives are they comparing?
- What information are they seeking (demos, case studies, pricing)?
- What sales touchpoints occur (discovery call, demo, trial)?
- What are the common sticking points at this stage?
- How does the buying committee get involved?

### 3. Decision Stage
Discuss the closing phase:
- What triggers the final buying decision?
- Who are the final decision-makers and what do they need?
- What does the proposal/pricing process look like?
- What are the common last-minute objections?
- What security/legal/procurement processes must be navigated?
- What is the typical close timeline?

### 4. Post-Purchase Stage
Discuss the handoff and expansion:
- How is the handoff from sales to customer success managed?
- What does the first 30 days post-purchase look like?
- When do expansion/upsell conversations begin?
- How does the sales team stay connected for future opportunities?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the complete buyer journey map back to the user. Write the **Buyer Journey Map** section of the output document.
