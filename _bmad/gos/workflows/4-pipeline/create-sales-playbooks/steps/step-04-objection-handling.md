# Step 4: Objection Handling

## STEP GOAL:
Build the comprehensive objection library with response frameworks, and create competitive battle cards.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Objection Library
Engage the user in discussion about the top objections by category:

**Price Objections:**
- "It's too expensive" -- what is the response framework?
- "We don't have the budget right now" -- how to handle?
- "Your competitor is cheaper" -- what is the positioning?
- Other common price objections?

**Timing Objections:**
- "Now is not the right time" -- how to create urgency?
- "We need to wait until next quarter/year" -- how to advance?
- "We're in the middle of another project" -- how to handle?

**Competition Objections:**
- "We're already evaluating [competitor]" -- how to differentiate?
- "We already use [incumbent]" -- how to position switching?
- "What makes you different from [competitor]?" -- key differentiators?

**Authority Objections:**
- "I need to check with my team/boss" -- how to coach the champion?
- "We have a committee decision process" -- how to navigate?
- "Legal/procurement needs to review" -- how to facilitate?

**Need Objections:**
- "We don't really need this" -- how to re-establish pain?
- "Our current process works fine" -- how to reveal hidden costs?
- "This isn't a priority" -- how to reframe urgency?

**Trust Objections:**
- "How do I know this will work?" -- what proof points to share?
- "You're too small/new" -- how to build confidence?
- "What about data security?" -- what assurances to provide?

### 2. Objection Response Framework
Discuss the methodology:
- What is the response pattern (acknowledge, question, reframe, prove)?
- When should an objection be addressed vs. parked?
- How should reps practice and internalize objection responses?

### 3. Competitive Battle Cards
For each major competitor, discuss:
- What is their positioning and messaging?
- What are their strengths that prospects will cite?
- What are their weaknesses to highlight?
- What questions expose their weaknesses without negative selling?
- What are the head-to-head comparison points?
- What win stories exist against this competitor?
- What is the general competitive positioning statement?

### 4. Closing Techniques
Discuss closing approaches:
- What trial close questions gauge buying readiness?
- What closing techniques fit the sales style (assumptive, summary, urgency)?
- What is the negotiation framework (what can be discounted, what cannot)?
- What are the discount authorization rules?

### 5. Synthesize
Present the objection library, battle cards, and closing techniques back to the user. Write the **Objection Library**, **Competitive Battle Cards**, and **Closing Techniques** sections of the output document.

### 6. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-04-objection-handling`.
