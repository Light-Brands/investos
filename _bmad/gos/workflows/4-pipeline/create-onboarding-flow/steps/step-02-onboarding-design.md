# Step 2: Onboarding Design

## STEP GOAL:
Design the day-by-day and week-by-week customer onboarding journey, welcome sequence, and sales-to-CS handoff protocol.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Customer Journey Design
Engage the user in discussion about:

**Day 1: Welcome and Setup**
- What happens immediately after purchase/signup?
- What is the first email or communication?
- What account setup steps are needed?
- What is the goal for Day 1 (account created, first login, basic configuration)?

**Week 1: Core Activation**
- What are the critical actions in the first week?
- What is the "aha moment" that demonstrates value?
- How many touchpoints in the first week (emails, calls, in-app)?
- What does success look like at end of Week 1?

**Month 1: Value Realization**
- What deeper features or workflows should be adopted?
- When does the first business review or check-in happen?
- What training or education is delivered?
- What does success look like at end of Month 1?

**Month 2-3: Deepening Engagement**
- How does the relationship evolve from onboarding to ongoing?
- When is the official "onboarding complete" moment?
- What triggers the transition to steady-state customer success?
- When do expansion conversations begin?

### 2. Welcome Sequence
Design the initial touchpoints:
- What does the welcome email series include (how many emails, timing, content)?
- Is there a welcome call or kickoff meeting? What is the agenda?
- What account setup guide or wizard exists?
- What resource library or knowledge base is introduced?
- What in-app onboarding experience exists (tooltips, tours, checklists)?

### 3. Sales-to-CS Handoff
Design the handoff protocol:
- What triggers the handoff (deal closed, contract signed, payment received)?
- What information transfers from sales to CS (discovery notes, use case, expectations)?
- What is the introduction protocol (warm intro email, joint call)?
- When does the joint account review happen?
- How is the customer introduced to their CS point of contact?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the customer journey, welcome sequence, and handoff protocol back to the user. Write the **Customer Journey**, **Welcome Sequence**, and **Handoff from Sales to CS** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-02-onboarding-design`.
