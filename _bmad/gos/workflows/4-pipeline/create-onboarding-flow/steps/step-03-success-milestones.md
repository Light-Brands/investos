# Step 3: Success Milestones

## STEP GOAL:
Define the key success milestones with health scoring, and design the training and education plan.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Success Milestones
Engage the user in discussion about:
- What are the 3-5 key milestones that indicate onboarding success?
- For each milestone:
  - What is the milestone name and description?
  - What is the expected timeline to reach this milestone?
  - What is the specific definition of done?
  - How does reaching (or missing) this milestone impact the health score?
- What is the correlation between milestone completion and long-term retention?
- What happens when a customer misses a milestone deadline?

### 2. Health Score Model
Discuss the customer health scoring approach:
- What factors contribute to the health score (feature adoption, engagement, support tickets, milestone completion)?
- How is the health score calculated (weighted factors)?
- What score ranges define healthy, at-risk, and critical?
- How often is the health score updated?
- Who monitors health scores and what are the response protocols?

### 3. Training / Education Plan
Design the customer education framework:

**Self-Service Resources:**
- What documentation, help articles, and FAQs are available?
- What video tutorials or walkthroughs exist?
- What community forums or knowledge bases can customers access?

**Guided Training:**
- What live training sessions are offered (1:1, group, webinar)?
- What is the training schedule and curriculum?
- How are training sessions customized by customer segment?

**Certification (if applicable):**
- Is there a certification program for power users?
- What levels or badges exist?
- How does certification drive adoption?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the success milestones, health score model, and training plan back to the user. Write the **Success Milestones** and **Training / Education Plan** sections of the output document.
