# Step 2: Segment & Journey Mapping

## STEP GOAL:
Define the audience segments for nurture and map the journey for each segment from first touch through conversion.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Segment Definitions
Engage the user in discussion about:
- How should the audience be segmented for nurture? Consider:
  - By persona/role (decision-maker, influencer, user)
  - By funnel stage (new lead, engaged lead, MQL, SQL)
  - By lead source (organic, paid, referral, event)
  - By industry or use case
  - By product interest
- What are the defining characteristics of each segment?
- How large is each segment currently?
- What data points are available for segmentation?
- How will segment membership be determined and maintained?

### 2. Journey Maps
For each key segment, discuss:
- What is the typical journey from awareness to purchase?
- What are the key touchpoints along the journey?
- What are the decision points where leads advance or stall?
- What content is most relevant at each stage?
- What triggers should move a lead from one stage to the next?
- What are the common objections or concerns at each stage?
- How does the nurture journey interact with sales touchpoints?

### 3. Journey Branching
Discuss how journeys split and merge:
- What behavioral signals trigger a journey branch (high engagement, specific page visit, form fill)?
- How do leads transition between segments?
- What happens when a lead shows buying intent mid-nurture (fast-track)?
- What happens when a lead goes cold mid-nurture?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the segment definitions and journey maps back to the user. Write the **Segment Definitions** and **Journey Maps** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
Append both sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-02-segment-journey-mapping`.
