# Step 4: Content Planning

## STEP GOAL:
Define the content framework for each funnel stage, the re-engagement strategy, and performance metrics.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Content Framework
Engage the user in discussion about:

**Top of Funnel Content:**
- What educational content builds awareness (blog posts, guides, infographics)?
- What thought leadership positions the brand as an authority?
- What content addresses the problem before the solution?

**Middle of Funnel Content:**
- What content helps evaluate solutions (comparison guides, case studies, webinars)?
- What social proof builds trust (testimonials, customer stories, data)?
- What content addresses common objections?

**Bottom of Funnel Content:**
- What content drives the purchase decision (demos, free trials, ROI calculators)?
- What urgency or scarcity elements are appropriate?
- What content supports the final buying committee discussion?

**Content Mapping:**
- How does each content piece map to specific sequence emails?
- What content gaps need to be filled?
- What is the content creation priority and timeline?

### 2. Re-engagement Strategy
Design the win-back approach:
- What signals indicate a lead has disengaged (no opens for X days, no clicks for Y days)?
- What does the re-engagement sequence look like (different subject lines, different offers, last chance)?
- How many re-engagement attempts before sunsetting?
- What is the sunset policy (when to remove from active nurture)?
- How are sunset leads handled (archive, periodic re-check, permanent removal)?

### 3. Performance Metrics
Define the measurement framework:
- What email-level metrics will be tracked (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate)?
- What sequence-level metrics matter (completion rate, conversion rate, time to convert)?
- What business impact metrics will be attributed to nurture (pipeline generated, revenue influenced)?
- What is the reporting cadence (weekly, monthly)?
- What benchmarks indicate healthy performance?
- What triggers optimization action?

### 4. Synthesize
Present the content framework, re-engagement strategy, and performance metrics back to the user. Write the **Content Framework**, **Re-engagement Strategy**, and **Performance Metrics** sections of the output document.

### 5. Save Progress
Append all three sections to `{outputFile}`. Update `stepsCompleted` to include `step-04-content-planning`.
