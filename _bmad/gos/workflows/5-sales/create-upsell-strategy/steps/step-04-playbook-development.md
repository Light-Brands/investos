# Step 4: Playbook Development & Pricing

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to develop expansion playbooks for each trigger category, define pricing strategies for upgrades, and integrate customer health scoring.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are an Expansion Revenue Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference expansion matrix (Step 2) and triggers (Step 3) for consistency

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on playbooks, pricing strategies, and health score integration
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to revenue projections or implementation timeline
- Build playbooks collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Expansion Playbooks
For each trigger category from Step 3, develop a structured playbook:

**Usage Signal Playbook:**
- What is the outreach sequence when a usage trigger fires?
- Who initiates contact? (CSM, AE, automated)
- What messaging and positioning is used?
- What is the offer or CTA?
- What is the expected timeline from trigger to close?

**Time-Based Playbook:**
- How far in advance of renewal/milestone does outreach begin?
- What is the multi-touch cadence?
- What QBR or review agenda drives the conversation?
- What data or ROI report supports the expansion case?

**Event-Based Playbook:**
- How quickly should outreach happen after an event trigger?
- What personalization references the specific event?
- What urgency or relevance framing is used?

**Health Score Playbook:**
- At what health score threshold is a customer "expansion ready"?
- What playbook runs for high-health customers?
- What playbook runs for at-risk customers who might still have expansion potential?

### 2. Pricing Strategies for Upgrades
Design upgrade pricing approaches:

**Upgrade Pricing Models:**
- How is the upgrade price calculated? (prorated, full, credited)
- What pricing psychology principles are applied? (anchoring, decoy, etc.)
- How are multi-year commitments priced?

**Discount & Incentive Frameworks:**
- What discount authority exists for expansion deals?
- What incentives encourage upgrades? (free trial of higher tier, limited-time pricing)
- What loyalty or tenure-based pricing exists?

**Grandfathering Policies:**
- How are existing customers treated during price increases?
- What grandfathering windows or tiers exist?
- How is grandfathering communicated?

**Annual Commitment Incentives:**
- What discount or benefit exists for annual vs. monthly commitments?
- What multi-year incentives are offered?

### 3. Customer Health Score Integration
Design the health score model for expansion:

**Health Score Components:**
- What metrics compose the health score? (usage, engagement, support, NPS, etc.)
- How are components weighted?
- What is the scoring scale?

**Score Thresholds & Actions:**
- What score indicates "expansion ready"?
- What score indicates "at risk"?
- What automated actions trigger at each threshold?

**Expansion Readiness Indicators:**
- Beyond health score, what signals indicate a customer is ready for expansion?
- How do health scores integrate with the triggers identified in Step 3?
