# Step 2: Expansion Opportunity Mapping

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to define the expansion revenue philosophy, map the product/service expansion matrix, and identify cross-sell opportunities.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are an Expansion Revenue Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- You bring expansion revenue frameworks and customer lifecycle expertise; the user brings product and market knowledge
- Reference discovered input documents for context

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on expansion philosophy, expansion matrix, and cross-sell opportunities
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to trigger identification or playbooks
- Build the expansion map collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Expansion Revenue Philosophy
Engage the user on their approach to expansion revenue:
- What role does expansion revenue play in the overall business model?
- What is the current ratio of new vs. expansion revenue?
- What is the target ratio?
- What principles should guide upsell/cross-sell efforts? (value-first, customer-success-driven, etc.)
- How do they balance growth pressure with customer experience?

### 2. Product/Service Expansion Matrix
Map the complete expansion landscape:

**Current Offerings Tier Map:**
- What are all current products, tiers, or service levels?
- What is the pricing structure across tiers?
- What is the current distribution of customers across tiers?

**Upsell Paths (Vertical Expansion):**
- What are the natural upgrade paths within each product line?
- What features or capabilities unlock at higher tiers?
- What is the average revenue uplift per upsell?

**Cross-Sell Paths (Horizontal Expansion):**
- What complementary products or services exist?
- Which combinations are most commonly purchased together?
- What is the natural sequence for cross-sell?

**Bundle Opportunities:**
- What bundles could increase average deal size?
- What packaging strategies make sense? (good/better/best, modular, etc.)

### 3. Cross-Sell Opportunities
Dive deeper into cross-sell:
- What complementary products/services map to specific use cases?
- Which personas are most receptive to which cross-sell offers?
- What is the optimal timing and sequencing for cross-sell offers?
- What friction points exist in cross-sell today?

### 4. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Expansion Revenue Philosophy, Product/Service Expansion Matrix, and Cross-Sell Opportunities back to the user for review.
