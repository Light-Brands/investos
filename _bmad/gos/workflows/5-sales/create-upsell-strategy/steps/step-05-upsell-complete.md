# Step 5: Revenue Projections & Completion

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to develop revenue projections, define the implementation timeline, and finalize the complete upsell strategy document.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are an Expansion Revenue Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference all prior steps for consistency across the complete document

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus on revenue projections, implementation timeline, and final document assembly
- This is the FINAL step - ensure document completeness

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Revenue Projections
Build the expansion revenue model collaboratively:

**Expansion Revenue Model:**
- What is the current customer base size and segmentation?
- What is the current expansion revenue rate?
- What conversion rate is expected per trigger type?
- What is the average expansion deal size?

**Assumptions & Inputs:**
- What assumptions underpin the projections?
- What data is available vs. estimated?
- What external factors could impact projections?

**Scenario Analysis:**
- Conservative scenario: What if only 50% of triggers convert at baseline rates?
- Base scenario: What are expected conversion rates with the new playbooks?
- Aggressive scenario: What if playbooks exceed expectations by 25-50%?

### 2. Implementation Timeline
Define the phased rollout:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2):**
- What infrastructure, tooling, and data work is needed?
- What health score model needs to be built?
- What training is required?

**Phase 2: Launch (Month 3-4):**
- Which playbooks launch first? (highest impact, lowest complexity)
- What pilot group or segment tests the approach?
- What feedback loops are established?

**Phase 3: Optimization (Month 5-6):**
- How are playbooks refined based on results?
- What scaling decisions are made?
- What automation is added?

**Success Metrics:**
- What KPIs measure success? (expansion revenue, net revenue retention, upsell conversion rate)
- What are the targets for each phase?
- What is the reporting cadence?

### 3. Final Document Review
Present the complete document structure to the user:
- Expansion Revenue Philosophy
- Product/Service Expansion Matrix
- Upsell Triggers (4 categories)
- Cross-Sell Opportunities
- Expansion Playbooks (4 playbooks)
- Pricing Strategies for Upgrades
- Customer Health Score Integration
- Revenue Projections (3 scenarios)
- Implementation Timeline (3 phases)

Ask the user to review the complete document and identify any gaps or revisions.

### 4. Save Final Document
Append Revenue Projections and Implementation Timeline to `{outputFile}`. Update frontmatter:
- Add `5` to `stepsCompleted` array
- Set `status: complete`

### 5. Present Completion
"Your upsell strategy document is complete!

**Final Document:** `{outputFile}`
