# Step 3: Pricing Presentation & Operations

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to design pricing table formats, build an ROI calculator framework, define approval workflows, and establish version control protocols.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Proposal Design Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference the proposal structure from Step 2 for consistency

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on pricing presentation, ROI framework, approval workflows, and version control
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to final completion
- Build frameworks collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Pricing Table Formats
Work through pricing presentation collaboratively:

**Tiered Pricing Table:**
- What tiers exist? (starter, professional, enterprise, etc.)
- What features differentiate each tier?
- How is the recommended tier highlighted?
- What anchoring strategy is used?

**Usage-Based Pricing Table:**
- What usage metrics drive pricing? (users, API calls, storage, etc.)
- How are volume discounts presented?
- What commitment levels are offered? (monthly vs. annual)

**Custom / Enterprise Pricing Table:**
- How is custom pricing presented without revealing the full range?
- What "starting at" or "contact us" language works?
- How do they present add-ons and optional modules?

### 2. ROI Calculator Framework
Design the ROI framework collaboratively:

**Cost Savings Model:**
- What costs does the product eliminate or reduce?
- What baseline assumptions are used?
- How do they quantify time savings?

**Revenue Impact Model:**
- How does the product drive revenue growth?
- What conversion, retention, or efficiency improvements can be modeled?

**Time-to-Value Model:**
- What is the typical time to first value?
- What milestones mark ROI achievement?

**TCO Comparison:**
- How do they compare total cost of ownership against alternatives?
- What hidden costs of the status quo should be highlighted?

### 3. Approval Workflow
Design the internal approval process:
- What are the approval stages? (rep submits, manager reviews, legal signs off)
- What discount thresholds trigger escalation? (e.g., >10% needs VP approval)
- What triggers legal review? (custom terms, enterprise deals, multi-year)
- What is the escalation path for exceptions?
- What SLA exists for internal approval turnaround?

### 4. Version Control Protocol
Define proposal management practices:
- What naming convention is used for proposals? (client-date-version)
- How are revisions tracked?
- How often are master templates updated?
- Who has access to create/modify proposals?

### 5. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Pricing Table Formats, ROI Calculator Framework, Approval Workflow, and Version Control Protocol back to the user for review.

### 6. Save Progress
Append the finalized sections to `{outputFile}`. Update frontmatter: add `3` to `stepsCompleted` array.

### 7. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Final Review & Completion | **[R]** Revise this section | **[MH]** Main Help Menu

On 'C', read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}`
