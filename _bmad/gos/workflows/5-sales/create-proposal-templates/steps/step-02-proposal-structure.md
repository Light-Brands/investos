# Step 2: Proposal Structure Design

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to define the proposal philosophy and design the complete proposal template structure including cover page, executive summary, solution overview, implementation timeline, team presentation, and terms.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Proposal Design Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- You bring proposal strategy and deal structuring expertise; the user brings product and pricing knowledge
- Reference discovered input documents for context

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on proposal philosophy and template structure
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to pricing presentation or ROI frameworks
- Build structure collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Proposal Philosophy
Engage the user on their approach to proposals:
- What is the primary goal of their proposals? (educate, persuade, formalize?)
- What tone should proposals convey? (premium, consultative, technical, friendly?)
- How long should a typical proposal be?
- What differentiates a winning proposal from a losing one in their experience?
- What are the non-negotiable elements every proposal must include?

### 2. Proposal Template - Core Sections
Work through each section collaboratively:

**Cover Page:**
- What branding elements are required?
- What information appears on the cover? (logos, project name, date, prepared for/by)
- Do they use custom covers per prospect or a standard template?

**Executive Summary:**
- What is the formula for a compelling exec summary?
- How do they frame the problem, solution, and outcome?
- What length and format works? (1 page, bullet points, narrative?)

**Solution Overview:**
- How do they structure the solution description?
- What level of technical detail is appropriate?
- How do they connect features to the prospect's specific pain points?
- What visual elements support the solution (diagrams, screenshots, architecture)?

**Implementation Timeline:**
- What is the typical implementation structure? (phases, milestones, duration)
- What deliverables map to each phase?
- How do they communicate dependencies and responsibilities?

**Team & Resources:**
- What team members are featured? (account manager, implementation lead, support)
- What credentials or experience highlights build confidence?
- How do they present the ongoing support model?

**Terms & Conditions:**
- What standard terms are included?
- What payment terms are typical?
- What warranty, SLA, or guarantee language is standard?

### 3. Case Study Integration
Discuss how case studies fit into proposals:
- What criteria determine which case studies to include?
- Where in the proposal do case studies appear?
- What is the standard case study format? (challenge, solution, results)
- How many case studies per proposal?

### 4. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Proposal Philosophy, Proposal Template structure, and Case Study Integration approach back to the user for review.

### 5. Save Progress
Append the finalized sections to `{outputFile}`. Update frontmatter: add `2` to `stepsCompleted` array.

### 6. Present Menu
