# Step 4: Objection Response Library

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to build a comprehensive objection response library organized by category, plus voicemail scripts and email follow-up templates.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Sales Script Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference call and demo scripts from Steps 2-3 for consistency

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on objection responses, voicemail scripts, and email follow-up templates
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to conversation guides
- Build response library collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Objection Response Library
Work through each objection category collaboratively:

**Pricing Objections:**
- What are the top 3-5 pricing objections they hear?
- For each: what is the acknowledge-explore-respond framework?
- What ROI data or proof points counter pricing concerns?

**Timing Objections:**
- "Not the right time," "We're too busy," "Maybe next quarter"
- What urgency or cost-of-delay arguments work?
- How do they keep the door open if timing is genuinely bad?

**Competitor Objections:**
- "We're already using X," "Your competitor does Y"
- What are the key differentiators to highlight?
- How do they handle competitors they know vs. ones they don't?

**Authority / Decision-Making Objections:**
- "I need to check with my boss," "This needs committee approval"
- How do they coach champions to sell internally?
- What materials support multi-stakeholder decisions?

**Status Quo / Inertia Objections:**
- "What we have works fine," "The switching cost is too high"
- What cost-of-inaction arguments resonate?
- How do they paint the future state vs. current state?

### 2. Voicemail Scripts
Develop voicemail scripts collaboratively:
- Cold voicemail: What hook + CTA fits in 30 seconds?
- Follow-up voicemail: How do they reference prior outreach?
- Break-up voicemail: What final message creates FOMO or urgency?

### 3. Email Follow-Up Templates
Develop email templates collaboratively:
- Post-cold call follow-up: Recap + value + next step
- Post-demo follow-up: Key takeaways + next steps + timeline
- Re-engagement follow-up: New trigger or value to re-open conversation
- Break-up email: Final attempt with clear door-open language

### 4. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Objection Response Library, Voicemail Scripts, and Email Follow-Up Templates back to the user for review.

### 5. Save Progress
