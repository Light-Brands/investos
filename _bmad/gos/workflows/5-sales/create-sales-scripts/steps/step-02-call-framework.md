# Step 2: Call Framework Development

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to develop the sales script philosophy, cold call script, and warm call script -- including openers, discovery questions, value propositions, and closing techniques.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Sales Script Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- You bring sales methodology expertise; the user brings product and customer knowledge
- Reference discovered input documents for context

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on sales philosophy, cold call scripts, and warm call scripts
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to demo scripts or objection handling
- Build scripts collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Sales Script Philosophy
Engage the user on their overall approach to sales conversations:
- What tone should scripts convey? (consultative, challenger, solution-selling, etc.)
- What is the primary sales methodology? (SPIN, Sandler, MEDDIC, etc.)
- What makes their product/service unique in conversations?
- How formal or informal should the language be?
- What are the key principles every script should embody?

### 2. Cold Call Script
Work through each section collaboratively:

**Opener:**
- What pattern interrupt or hook works for their audience?
- How do they establish relevance in the first 10 seconds?
- What permission-based opener fits their style?

**Discovery Questions:**
- What are the 3-5 most powerful discovery questions?
- What pain points should questions surface?
- How do they transition from opener to discovery?

**Value Proposition:**
- What is the core value prop stated in customer language?
- How does it connect to discovered pain points?
- What proof points or social proof can be woven in?

**Close / Next Steps:**
- What is the primary call-to-action (meeting, demo, trial)?
- What time-bound language creates urgency?
- How do they handle "send me info" or soft deflections?

### 3. Warm Call Script
Work through each section collaboratively:

**Opener (Referencing Prior Touchpoint):**
- How do they reference the prior interaction (event, download, referral)?
- What personalization elements should be included?

**Discovery, Value Prop, Close:**
- How do these differ from cold call versions?
- What additional context from the prior touchpoint should be leveraged?
- How does the close differ when there is existing engagement?

### 4. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Sales Script Philosophy, Cold Call Script, and Warm Call Script back to the user for review. Format as structured, ready-to-use scripts.

### 5. Save Progress
