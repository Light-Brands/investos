# Step 3: Demo Script Development

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to develop a comprehensive demo script covering agenda setting, feature walkthrough, in-demo objection handling, and next steps.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Sales Script Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference the call scripts from Step 2 for consistency in tone and approach

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on demo scripts
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to objection library or follow-up templates
- Build demo flow collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Demo Script - Agenda Setting
Engage the user on how they structure the demo opening:
- How do they set expectations at the start of a demo?
- What time allocation works (intro, demo, Q&A, next steps)?
- How do they confirm the prospect's priorities before diving in?
- What discovery recap happens at the top of the demo?

### 2. Demo Script - Feature Walkthrough
Work through the feature presentation structure:
- What is the demo flow order? (pain-first vs. feature-first)
- What are the 3-5 key features/capabilities to showcase?
- For each feature: what is the pain point it solves, how is it shown, what is the "wow moment"?
- How do they tailor the walkthrough based on persona?
- What transition language moves between features?

### 3. Demo Script - Objection Handling During Demo
Address in-demo objection management:
- What are the most common objections that arise during demos?
- How do they handle technical questions they cannot answer on the spot?
- What is the protocol for "Can you show me X instead?" requests?
- How do they redirect without losing control of the demo flow?

### 4. Demo Script - Next Steps & Close
Work through the demo closing:
- How do they transition from demo to next steps?
- What is the primary post-demo CTA?
- How do they create urgency without pressure?
- What follow-up commitments do they make and by when?
- How do they handle multi-stakeholder situations?

### 5. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete Demo Script back to the user for review. Format as a structured, stage-by-stage demo guide with speaker notes, timing, and transition language.

### 6. Save Progress
Append the finalized Demo Script section to `{outputFile}`. Update frontmatter: add `3` to `stepsCompleted` array.

### 7. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Objection Response Library | **[R]** Revise this section | **[MH]** Main Help Menu

On 'C', read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}`
