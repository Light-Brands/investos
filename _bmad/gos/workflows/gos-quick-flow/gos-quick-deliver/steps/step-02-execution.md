# Step 2: Execution

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to build the deliverable content, run the quality checklist, and define the distribution plan. Build it right, build it fast.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are Dash. Build it. Ship it. Done.
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- If a spec exists, follow it. If not, get clear direction from the user.
- Execute efficiently. Ask for input where needed, draft where you can.

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Build the COMPLETE deliverable in this step
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to delivery completion
- Build collaboratively but efficiently

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Deliverable Creation
Build the deliverable based on the spec or user brief:

**Type Confirmation:**
- Confirm the deliverable type (email, landing page copy, ad copy, blog post, sales deck, social posts, etc.)
- Confirm the specific format and length requirements

**Content Building:**
- Work with the user to build the content collaboratively
- If the spec has requirements, work through each must-have
- Draft sections and get user feedback before proceeding
- Maintain brand voice and audience fit throughout
- Build the complete deliverable content

### 2. Quality Checklist
Run through the quality gates:

**Brand Alignment:**
- Does the tone match the brand voice?
- Are brand guidelines followed? (terminology, style, visual direction)

**Audience Fit:**
- Is the messaging appropriate for the target audience?
- Does it speak to their pain points and motivations?
- Is the language and complexity level right?

**Channel Optimization:**
- Is the content optimized for the target channel? (length, format, CTA style)
- Does it follow channel best practices?

**Technical Quality:**
- Is the copy clean? (no typos, grammar issues, broken links)
- Are all placeholders filled in?
- Are CTAs clear and actionable?

**Stakeholder Review:**
- Does this need stakeholder approval before ship?
- If yes, who and by when?

### 3. Distribution Plan
Define how this gets shipped:

**Channels & Timing:**
- Where exactly does this get published or sent?
- What date and time?
- What timezone considerations exist?

**Audience Targeting:**
- Who specifically receives or sees this?
- What segmentation or targeting is applied?

**Follow-Up Actions:**
- What happens after the deliverable ships? (tracking, follow-up sequence, reporting)
- Who is responsible for monitoring?

**Success Tracking:**
- What metrics will be tracked?
- When is the first check-in on performance?

### 4. Synthesize & Present
Present the complete deliverable, quality checklist results, and distribution plan back to the user for review.

### 5. Save Progress
Append the finalized deliverable, quality checklist, and distribution plan to `{outputFile}`. Update frontmatter: add `2` to `stepsCompleted` array.

### 6. Present Menu
**[C]** Continue to Ship | **[R]** Revise this section | **[MH]** Main Help Menu
