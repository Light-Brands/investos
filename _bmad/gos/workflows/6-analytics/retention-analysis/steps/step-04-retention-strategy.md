# Step 4: Retention Strategy & Win-Back

## STEP GOAL:
Collaborate with the user to develop the retention strategy including proactive interventions and re-engagement campaigns, build the win-back playbook, and define retention metrics and targets.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Retention Analytics Architect and facilitator
- If you already have a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those
- Reference churn analysis and health score model from Step 3 for context

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus ONLY on retention strategy, win-back playbook, and metrics/targets
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to final completion
- Build strategy collaboratively, not autonomously

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Retention Strategy
Design the retention playbook:

**Proactive Interventions:**
- What proactive actions prevent churn before it happens?
- Onboarding optimization: How do they ensure new customers reach value quickly?
- Regular check-ins: What cadence of proactive outreach exists?
- Success milestones: What celebrations or acknowledgments happen when customers achieve goals?
- Feature adoption campaigns: How do they drive deeper product usage?
- For each intervention: trigger, action, owner, expected impact

**Re-Engagement Campaigns:**
- What automated campaigns target declining engagement?
- What messaging and CTAs bring disengaged customers back?
- What incentives, if any, are offered for re-engagement?
- What is the multi-touch sequence? (email, in-app, phone)
- At what point does a re-engagement campaign escalate to human outreach?

**At-Risk Customer Playbook:**
- What is the step-by-step playbook when a customer is flagged "at risk"?
- Who is responsible for each step?
- What is the timeline from flag to resolution?
- What save offers or concessions can be made?
- What is the escalation path if initial efforts fail?

**Loyalty & Reward Programs:**
- Does a loyalty or reward program make sense?
- What would it look like? (tenure discounts, feature access, community perks)
- What customer behaviors should it incentivize?
- What is the expected ROI?

### 2. Win-Back Playbook
Design the process for recovering churned customers:

**Win-Back Eligibility Criteria:**
- Which churned customers are worth pursuing?
- What filters apply? (churn reason, tenure, value, relationship quality)
- What exclusions exist? (hostile departure, competitor acquisition, business closure)

**Win-Back Timing:**
- How soon after churn does win-back outreach begin?
- What is the win-back campaign duration?
- Are there "win-back windows" tied to product updates or events?

**Win-Back Messaging & Offers:**
- What messaging acknowledges the churn and presents a reason to return?
- What offers incentivize return? (discount, free period, new features, concierge onboarding)
- How do offers differ by churn reason?
- What is the multi-touch sequence?

**Win-Back Success Metrics:**
- What is the target win-back rate?
- How is win-back ROI measured?
- What is the retention rate of won-back customers?

### 3. Retention Metrics & Targets
Define the measurement framework:

**Primary Retention KPIs:**
- What are the 5-7 primary retention KPIs?
- How is each calculated?
- What data source provides each?

**Targets by Time Horizon:**
- What are the 90-day targets?
- What are the 6-month targets?
- What are the 12-month targets?

**Reporting & Review Cadence:**
- How often are retention metrics reviewed?
- What is the format? (dashboard, report, meeting)
- Who attends the review?

**Accountability:**
- Who owns each retention KPI?
- What escalation happens when targets are missed?

### 4. Synthesize & Present
