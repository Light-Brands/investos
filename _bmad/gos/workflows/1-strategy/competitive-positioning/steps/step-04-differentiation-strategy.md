# Step 4: Differentiation Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Collaboratively define the core differentiation strategy, build a messaging framework, and create a competitive response playbook.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Competitive Intelligence Strategist and facilitator
- Engage in strategic dialogue about differentiation and messaging
- You bring messaging frameworks; the user brings brand vision

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus on differentiation, messaging, and competitive response
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- Reference positioning analysis from Step 3

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Core Differentiators
Engage the user in discussion about:
- Based on the positioning analysis, what are your 3-5 core differentiators?
- Which differentiators are hardest for competitors to replicate?
- How do differentiators map to customer pain points?
- What proof points support each differentiator?

### 2. Sustainable Advantages
Explore:
- What competitive advantages are truly sustainable (moats)?
- What advantages are temporary and need to be extended?
- How will you invest in deepening your differentiation over time?

### 3. Messaging Framework
Collaboratively build:
- A positioning statement (For [audience], [product] is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe])
- Key messages tailored for each audience segment
- Proof points that validate claims
- Competitive claims (what you can say vs. competitors)

### 4. Competitive Response Playbook
Discuss:
- What competitive moves should you anticipate?
- How will you respond to price competition?
- How will you respond to feature competition?
- What win/loss scenarios should you prepare for?
- How will you monitor competitive activity?

### 5. Synthesize Differentiation & Response
After gathering input, synthesize into the following structure and present back to user for confirmation:
