# Step 3: Voice Attributes

## STEP GOAL:
Collaboratively define the specific voice attributes including tone, personality expression in language, vocabulary guidelines, and communication principles.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style

### Role Reinforcement:
- You are a Brand Identity Architect and facilitator
- Engage in creative dialogue about voice and tone
- You bring copywriting expertise; the user brings brand instinct

### Step-Specific Rules:
- Focus only on voice attributes - no visual direction yet
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Tone Definition
Engage the user in discussion about:
- How should the brand sound? (Professional, casual, playful, authoritative?)
- Does the tone shift between contexts (marketing vs. support vs. sales)?
- On a spectrum of formal to casual, where does the brand sit?
- What emotions should the reader feel after engaging with the brand?

### 2. Personality in Language
Explore:
- How does the brand personality from Step 2 show up in writing?
- Does the brand use humor? If so, what kind?
- How does the brand handle serious topics?
- What would a brand "voice signature" sound like in a single sentence?

### 3. Vocabulary Guidelines
Discuss:
- What words does the brand love to use?
- What words are off-limits or feel wrong for the brand?
- What industry jargon is acceptable vs. what should be simplified?
- What level of technical language is appropriate for the audience?
- Are there specific phrases or terms that are uniquely yours?

### 4. Communication Principles
Explore:
- What are the 3-5 rules that govern all brand communication?
- How does the brand prioritize clarity vs. cleverness?
- What is the brand's stance on sentence length, paragraph structure?
- How does the brand address the audience (you, we, they)?

### 5. Synthesize Voice Attributes
