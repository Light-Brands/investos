# Step 2: Competitive Landscape

## STEP GOAL:
Map the competitive landscape, analyze competitor positioning, identify differentiation opportunities, and establish where the offering sits relative to alternatives available to investors.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Competitor Identification
Work with the user to identify competitors across categories:
- **Direct Competitors**: Offerings in the same space, same regulation type
- **Indirect Competitors**: Adjacent offerings competing for the same investor dollars
- **Alternative Investments**: Other investment opportunities investors are evaluating
- **Traditional Alternatives**: Public market equivalents, ETFs, REITs, etc.

### 2. Competitor Profile Analysis
For each key competitor (top 3-5), gather from the user:
- **Company/Offering Name**: Full name and offering type
- **Raise Amount and Status**: How much raised, current stage
- **Value Proposition**: How they position themselves to investors
- **Target Investor**: Who they are targeting
- **Distribution Channels**: Where and how they market
- **Strengths**: What they do well
- **Weaknesses**: Where they fall short
- **Investor Communications**: Quality of their investor-facing content

### 3. Competitive Positioning Map
Create a positioning map with the user:
- Define the two most important dimensions (e.g., risk/return, innovation/stability)
- Place competitors and the user's offering on the map
- Identify white space and crowded areas
- Discuss positioning implications

### 4. Differentiation Analysis
Work with the user to identify:
- What makes this offering genuinely different from competitors?
- Is the differentiation defensible?
- How well is the differentiation currently communicated?
- What proof points support the differentiation claims?

### 5. Competitive Intelligence Summary
Compile findings into:
- Competitive landscape overview map
- Individual competitor profiles
- Key differentiation opportunities
- Competitive threats to monitor

### Save Progress
