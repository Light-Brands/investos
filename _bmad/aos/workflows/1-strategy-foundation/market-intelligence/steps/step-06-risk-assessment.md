# Step 6: Risk Assessment

## STEP GOAL:
Identify and assess market-related risks that could impact the offering's success, develop mitigation strategies, and establish monitoring indicators for early warning.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Market Risk Categories
Guide the user through identifying risks in each category:

**External Market Risks**
- Economic downturn or recession impact on investment appetite
- Interest rate changes affecting alternative investment attractiveness
- Public market volatility creating investor uncertainty
- Geopolitical events disrupting market confidence

**Sector-Specific Risks**
- Industry-specific regulatory changes
- Technology disruption within the sector
- Competitor actions (aggressive campaigns, price competition)
- Sector reputation events (high-profile failures)

**Campaign Execution Risks**
- Investor acquisition cost exceeding budget
- Platform or distribution channel failures
- Content or messaging not resonating with target segments
- Compliance issues delaying or halting marketing

**Timing Risks**
- Market windows closing before campaign reaches scale
- Competing offerings launching during the same period
- Seasonal patterns affecting investor behavior
- Regulatory filing delays impacting launch timeline

### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix
For each identified risk, assess with the user:
| Risk | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Category |
|------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|

### 3. Mitigation Strategies
For each high-priority risk (score >= 12), develop:
- **Prevention**: What can be done to reduce the probability?
- **Preparation**: What can be prepared in advance in case it happens?
- **Response**: What is the immediate action plan if the risk materializes?
- **Recovery**: How to recover if the risk causes damage?

### 4. Early Warning Indicators
Define monitoring indicators for the top risks:
- What leading indicators signal this risk is increasing?
- How will these indicators be monitored?
- What threshold triggers escalation or action?
- Who is responsible for monitoring each indicator?

### 5. Risk Register Summary
Compile the complete risk register with mitigation plans and monitoring assignments.

### Save Progress
