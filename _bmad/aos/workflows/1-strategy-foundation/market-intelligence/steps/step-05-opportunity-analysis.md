# Step 5: Opportunity Analysis

## STEP GOAL:
Synthesize competitive, sentiment, and trend intelligence into actionable opportunities, defining strategic implications for campaign positioning, messaging, and investor targeting.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Opportunity Identification
Based on all intelligence gathered, work with the user to identify opportunities:
- **Positioning Opportunities**: Gaps in competitor messaging or market positioning
- **Timing Opportunities**: Market windows, trend alignment, seasonal factors
- **Channel Opportunities**: Underutilized channels where competitors are weak
- **Messaging Opportunities**: Narratives that resonate with current sentiment
- **Audience Opportunities**: Underserved investor segments

### 2. Opportunity Prioritization
For each opportunity, assess with the user:
- **Impact Potential**: How much could this opportunity move the needle? (1-5)
- **Feasibility**: How achievable is this with current resources? (1-5)
- **Time Sensitivity**: How quickly must we act? (Urgent / Near-term / Flexible)
- **Risk Level**: What is the downside of pursuing this opportunity? (Low / Med / High)

### 3. Strategic Implications
Translate opportunities into strategic recommendations:
- **Positioning Strategy**: How should the offering be positioned given the landscape?
- **Messaging Strategy**: What key narratives should the campaign emphasize?
- **Channel Strategy**: Where should resources be concentrated?
- **Timing Strategy**: When should different campaign elements launch?
- **Differentiation Strategy**: How to stand out in the current environment?

### 4. Competitive Response Scenarios
Discuss potential competitive responses:
- How might competitors react to the campaign?
- What messaging counter-moves should be prepared?
- Are there first-mover advantages to capture?

### 5. Opportunity Roadmap
Create a prioritized opportunity roadmap:
| Priority | Opportunity | Strategy | Timeline | Resources Needed |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------------|

### Save Progress
Append opportunity analysis to the working output file.
