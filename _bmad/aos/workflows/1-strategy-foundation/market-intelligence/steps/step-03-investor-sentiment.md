# Step 3: Investor Sentiment

## STEP GOAL:
Assess the current investor sentiment landscape, understanding appetite for the offering type, regulation type, and sector, and identifying sentiment-driven opportunities and headwinds.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Macro Investor Sentiment
Discuss with the user the broader sentiment environment:
- Overall alternative investment appetite (growing, stable, declining)
- Sentiment toward the specific regulation type (Reg A, Reg D, Reg CF)
- Interest rate and economic environment impact on investor behavior
- Public market conditions and their effect on private investment appetite
- Retail investor confidence levels

### 2. Sector-Specific Sentiment
Explore sentiment within the specific sector:
- Is the sector "hot" or "cold" with investors right now?
- Recent high-profile successes or failures in the sector
- Media coverage sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Social media buzz and community sentiment
- Analyst or expert opinions on the sector outlook

### 3. Direct Investor Feedback
Gather any firsthand investor sentiment data:
- Feedback from initial conversations with potential investors
- Response rates to preliminary outreach or "testing the waters"
- Common questions, concerns, or enthusiasm points
- Advisor or broker-dealer feedback on investor appetite
- Community or social proof indicators

### 4. Sentiment Risk Factors
Identify sentiment-related risks:
- What events could shift sentiment negatively?
- Are there pending regulatory changes that could affect appetite?
- Is there sector fatigue from too many similar offerings?
- Are there reputational risks from competitor failures?

### 5. Sentiment-Informed Messaging
Based on the sentiment analysis, discuss with the user:
- Which messaging angles align with positive sentiment currents?
- Which concerns should be proactively addressed in communications?
- How should the campaign tone reflect the current sentiment environment?
