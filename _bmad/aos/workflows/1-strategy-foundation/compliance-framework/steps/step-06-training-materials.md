# Step 6: Training Materials

## STEP GOAL:
Create compliance training materials that ensure all team members involved in investor communications understand regulatory requirements, review processes, and their individual responsibilities.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Training Audience Identification
Work with the user to identify who needs compliance training:
- **Content Creators**: Writers, designers, video producers
- **Marketing Team**: Campaign managers, social media managers
- **Leadership**: Executives who approve content or make claims
- **External Partners**: PR firms, agencies, freelancers
- **Platform Staff**: Customer service, community managers

### 2. Core Training Topics
Define the essential training modules:
- **Securities Regulation Basics**: What is a securities offering, why compliance matters
- **What You Can and Cannot Say**: Prohibited claims, required disclosures
- **Social Media Compliance**: Platform-specific rules and risks
- **Review and Approval Process**: How to submit content for review
- **Red Flags and Escalation**: When to stop and ask for help
- **Record-Keeping**: What to document and retain

### 3. Quick Reference Materials
Create practical reference materials:
- **Compliance Cheat Sheet**: One-page do's and don'ts
- **Approved Language Bank**: Pre-approved phrases and disclaimers
- **Prohibited Language List**: Words and claims to never use
- **Escalation Contact Card**: Who to contact with compliance questions

### 4. Training Delivery Plan
Discuss with the user:
- How will training be delivered (documents, live sessions, recorded)?
- How often should training be refreshed?
- How is training completion tracked?
- Are there certification or acknowledgment requirements?

### 5. Compliance FAQ
Build a FAQ document addressing common questions:
- Can I share the offering on my personal social media?
- Can I guarantee returns to potential investors?
- What do I do if an investor asks a question I am not sure about?
- How do I handle media inquiries about the offering?
- What happens if non-compliant content is accidentally published?
