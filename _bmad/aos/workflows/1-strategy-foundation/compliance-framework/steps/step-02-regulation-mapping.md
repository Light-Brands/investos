# Step 2: Regulation Mapping

## STEP GOAL:
Map all applicable federal and state regulations to the offering structure, identifying specific requirements, limitations, and obligations that will govern all investor communications.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Primary Regulation Framework
Based on the offering details from Step 1, identify and discuss with the user:
- **Primary Federal Exemption**: Reg A, Reg D, Reg CF -- specific section/tier
- **SEC Filing Requirements**: What must be filed and when
- **Offering Limits**: Maximum raise amounts, per-investor limits
- **Investor Qualification**: Accreditation requirements, self-certification
- **General Solicitation Rules**: What is and is not permitted

### 2. State Securities (Blue Sky) Considerations
Discuss with the user:
- Which states require notice filings or registrations?
- Are there state-specific investor limits or requirements?
- Does Reg A Tier 2 or federal preemption apply?
- What state anti-fraud provisions remain applicable?

### 3. Anti-Fraud Provisions
Map the always-applicable anti-fraud framework:
- **Rule 10b-5**: Material misstatements and omissions
- **Section 17(a)**: Fraud in the offer or sale of securities
- **State anti-fraud statutes**: Applicable state provisions
- What constitutes "material" information for this offering

### 4. Advertising and Communication Rules
Define the regulatory boundaries for marketing:
- What can be said before the offering is live?
- What can be said during the offering period?
- Are there "testing the waters" provisions available?
- Social media specific rules and limitations
- Tombstone ad requirements and restrictions

### 5. Ongoing Obligations
Identify post-offering regulatory obligations:
- Ongoing reporting requirements (Form 1-K, 1-SA, 1-U, annual reports)
- Investor communication obligations
- Bad actor disqualification monitoring
- Record-keeping requirements

### 6. Regulation Map Summary
Compile a clear regulation map table showing:
- Regulation > Specific Requirement > Applicability > Action Required
