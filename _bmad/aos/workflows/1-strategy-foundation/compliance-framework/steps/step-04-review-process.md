# Step 4: Review Process

## STEP GOAL:
Design a structured review process that ensures all investor-facing content is reviewed for regulatory compliance, accuracy, and brand alignment before distribution.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Review Tiers
Define review tiers based on content risk level with the user:
- **Tier 1 - High Risk**: Offering documents, SEC filings, financial statements
  - Requires legal counsel review + internal compliance review
- **Tier 2 - Medium Risk**: Pitch decks, email campaigns, landing pages
  - Requires internal compliance review + brand review
- **Tier 3 - Lower Risk**: Social posts, blog content, community updates
  - Requires compliance checklist self-review + spot checks

### 2. Review Checklist Design
Create a compliance review checklist for each tier:
- Are all required disclosures present and prominent?
- Are all claims factual and substantiated?
- Are projections properly qualified with safe harbor language?
- Are risk factors adequately disclosed near any performance claims?
- Is the content consistent with SEC filings and offering documents?
- Are testimonials or endorsements properly disclosed?
- Does the content comply with general solicitation rules?

### 3. Reviewer Roles and Responsibilities
Define with the user:
- Who performs compliance reviews? (internal team, legal counsel, both)
- What is the turnaround time expectation for each tier?
- Who has final authority to approve or reject content?
- How are disagreements between reviewers resolved?
- What is the escalation path for urgent content needs?

### 4. Review Documentation
Establish documentation requirements:
- What must be recorded for each review (date, reviewer, findings, decision)?
- How long must review records be retained?
- Where are review records stored?
- How are revisions tracked and documented?

### 5. Common Compliance Issues Reference
Build a quick-reference list of common compliance issues:
- Unsubstantiated performance claims
- Missing or buried disclaimers
- Inconsistency with offering documents
- Testimonials without proper disclosure
- Projections without safe harbor language
- Social media posts that constitute offers
