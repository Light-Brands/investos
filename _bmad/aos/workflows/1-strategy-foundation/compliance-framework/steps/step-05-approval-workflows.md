# Step 5: Approval Workflows

## STEP GOAL:
Build clear approval workflows with defined gates, escalation paths, and sign-off requirements that prevent non-compliant content from reaching investors.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Approval Workflow by Content Type
Define the approval workflow for each content category:

**Offering Documents (Circular, Form C, PPM)**
- Draft > Internal Review > Legal Counsel Review > Final Approval > Filing

**Marketing Materials (Deck, Email, Landing Page)**
- Draft > Compliance Checklist > Reviewer Approval > Distribution

**Ongoing Communications (Updates, Social, Blog)**
- Draft > Self-Review Checklist > Spot Check Queue > Publish

### 2. Gate Requirements
For each approval gate, define with the user:
- **Entry Criteria**: What must be true before content enters this gate?
- **Review Scope**: What is being reviewed at this gate?
- **Pass Criteria**: What must be true for content to pass this gate?
- **Fail Actions**: What happens when content fails (revise, escalate, reject)?
- **Timeout Rules**: What happens if review is not completed in time?

### 3. Sign-Off Protocol
Establish sign-off requirements:
- Who must sign off for each content tier?
- Is verbal approval sufficient or is written sign-off required?
- How are sign-offs recorded and stored?
- Can sign-off authority be delegated? Under what conditions?

### 4. Emergency/Expedited Approval
Define the fast-track process for urgent content:
- What qualifies as an emergency or time-sensitive situation?
- Who can authorize expedited review?
- What is the minimum review requirement even in emergencies?
- How is the expedited process documented after the fact?

### 5. Version Control and Audit Trail
Establish version control standards:
- How are content versions numbered and tracked?
- What changes require re-approval vs. minor update approval?
- How is the full approval history maintained for audit purposes?
- Retention period for approval records
