# Step 3: Disclosure Requirements

## STEP GOAL:
Define all required disclosures for the offering, including mandatory language, risk factors, disclaimers, and legends that must appear in investor-facing materials.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Mandatory Disclosure Inventory
Work with the user to catalog all required disclosures:
- **Offering Legend**: Required language about the offering status
- **Risk Disclosure**: General investment risk warnings
- **Forward-Looking Statements**: Safe harbor language for projections
- **No Guarantee Disclaimer**: No guarantee of returns or performance
- **Accreditation Notices**: Investor qualification requirements
- **Liquidity Warnings**: Restrictions on resale of securities
- **Conflict of Interest Disclosures**: Related party transactions, fees

### 2. Risk Factor Categories
Guide the user through identifying material risk factors:
- **Business Risks**: Operational, market, competitive risks
- **Financial Risks**: Capital needs, revenue uncertainty, debt obligations
- **Regulatory Risks**: Changes in law, compliance failures
- **Market Risks**: Economic conditions, industry-specific headwinds
- **Offering-Specific Risks**: Dilution, lack of liquidity, control issues
- **Management Risks**: Key person dependencies, experience gaps

### 3. Channel-Specific Disclosure Rules
Define how disclosures must appear in each channel:
- **Offering Documents**: Full disclosure requirements
- **Email Communications**: Required disclaimers and unsubscribe
- **Social Media**: Character-limited disclosure approaches, link requirements
- **Video Content**: Verbal and visual disclosure requirements
- **Landing Pages**: Prominence and placement requirements
- **Pitch Decks**: Slide-specific disclosure requirements

### 4. Disclosure Formatting Standards
Establish formatting rules:
- Minimum font size for disclaimers
- Prominence requirements (not hidden in footnotes)
- Plain language standards for readability
- Required placement (beginning, end, or proximity to claims)

### 5. Disclosure Templates
Create reusable disclosure language blocks:
- Standard offering disclaimer (short version)
- Standard offering disclaimer (long version)
- Risk factor summary language
- Forward-looking statement safe harbor
- Social media compliant disclaimer
