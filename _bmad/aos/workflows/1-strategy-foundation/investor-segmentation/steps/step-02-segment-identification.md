# Step 2: Segment Identification

## STEP GOAL:
Identify and define distinct investor segments based on demographics, psychographics, investment behavior, and regulatory eligibility. Typically 3-5 primary segments emerge.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Segmentation Framework
Introduce the segmentation dimensions to the user:
- **Regulatory**: Accredited vs. non-accredited, institutional vs. individual
- **Financial**: Investment capacity, net worth range, typical check size
- **Behavioral**: Active investor vs. first-time, platform preferences
- **Psychographic**: Motivations (returns, mission, access, community)
- **Demographic**: Age, profession, location, industry affiliation
- **Relationship**: Existing relationship vs. cold prospect, referral source

### 2. Identify Primary Segments
Guide the user through identifying 3-5 primary segments:
- For each potential segment, discuss:
  - What defines this group? What makes them distinct?
  - Approximately what percentage of target investors do they represent?
  - What is their expected average investment size?
  - What is their primary motivation for investing?
  - How accessible are they through available channels?

### 3. Segment Prioritization
Work with the user to prioritize segments:
- **Tier 1 (Primary)**: Highest probability of conversion, largest potential allocation
- **Tier 2 (Secondary)**: Important but lower priority or harder to reach
- **Tier 3 (Tertiary)**: Worth targeting but not primary focus
- Discuss why each segment is prioritized at its tier

### 4. Segment Overlap Analysis
Identify where segments overlap:
- Which segments share characteristics?
- Are there investors who belong to multiple segments?
- How will overlapping segments be handled in communications?

### 5. Segment Summary Table
Create a summary table with the user:
| Segment | Priority | Est. % | Avg Investment | Primary Motivation | Key Channel |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|

### Save Progress
Append segment identification to the working output file.
