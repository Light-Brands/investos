# Step 4: Communication Preferences

## STEP GOAL:
Map detailed communication preferences for each investor segment, defining preferred channels, messaging approaches, content types, frequency, and journey stages to enable personalized outreach.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Channel Preferences by Segment
For each persona/segment, define with the user:
- **Primary Channel**: Where they are most likely to first encounter the offering
- **Secondary Channels**: Where they go for more information
- **Decision Channel**: Where they ultimately commit to invest
- **Ongoing Channel**: Where they prefer to receive updates post-investment

### 2. Messaging Framework by Segment
For each segment, define:
- **Lead Message**: The primary value proposition that resonates most
- **Supporting Messages**: 2-3 supporting points that matter to this segment
- **Proof Points**: What evidence or social proof is most compelling
- **CTA Approach**: What call-to-action language works best
- **Tone Adjustment**: How should the brand voice flex for this segment

### 3. Content Type Preferences
Map preferred content types for each segment:
- Long-form analysis vs. executive summaries
- Video vs. written content
- Data-heavy vs. narrative-driven
- Case studies vs. projections
- Community content vs. formal communications

### 4. Communication Frequency and Cadence
Define for each segment:
- **Acquisition Phase**: How frequently to communicate during outreach
- **Consideration Phase**: How much nurturing content before a decision
- **Conversion Phase**: Follow-up cadence for interested-but-uncommitted
- **Post-Investment Phase**: Update frequency expectations
- **Fatigue Thresholds**: When does communication become excessive

### 5. Investor Journey Mapping
Map the typical journey for each segment:
1. **Awareness**: How they first learn about the opportunity
2. **Interest**: What makes them want to learn more
3. **Evaluation**: What information they need to evaluate
4. **Decision**: What triggers the investment decision
5. **Advocacy**: What makes them refer others

### 6. Segment Communication Matrix
Create a summary matrix:
| Segment | Primary Channel | Lead Message | Content Type | Frequency | Journey Length |
|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
