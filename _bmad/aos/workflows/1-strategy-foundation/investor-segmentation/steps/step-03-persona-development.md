# Step 3: Persona Development

## STEP GOAL:
Develop a detailed investor persona for each identified segment, bringing the data to life with narratives that guide content creation, messaging, and outreach strategy.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Persona Framework
Explain the persona components to the user:
- Each persona represents the "ideal" investor within a segment
- Personas make segments actionable for content creators
- They answer: "Who am I writing for and what do they care about?"

### 2. Build Each Persona
For each segment identified in Step 2, work with the user to define:

**Demographics**
- Name (fictional, representative)
- Age range
- Profession/Title
- Income/Net worth range
- Location/Region
- Education level

**Investment Profile**
- Investment experience level (novice, intermediate, sophisticated)
- Typical portfolio composition
- Risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- Investment decision timeline
- Previous alternative investment experience
- Typical investment amount for this type of offering

**Motivations and Goals**
- Primary investment motivation (returns, mission, access, diversification)
- What success looks like for this persona
- What triggers them to start researching an investment
- What triggers them to commit

**Pain Points and Objections**
- Top 3 concerns about this type of investment
- Common objections they would raise
- What information do they need to overcome objections
- Trust signals that matter most to them

**Information Consumption**
- Where do they get investment information (platforms, publications, people)?
- What content formats do they prefer?
- How much due diligence do they do before investing?
- Who influences their investment decisions?

### 3. Persona Narrative
For each persona, write a brief narrative (3-5 sentences) that brings the data to life:
- A day-in-the-life snapshot showing how they encounter and evaluate investments

### 4. Persona Validation
Ask the user to validate each persona:
- Does this feel like a real person you would encounter?
- Is anything missing or inaccurate?
- Would your team recognize this investor type?

### Save Progress
Append developed personas to the working output file.
