# Step 2: Brand Audit

## STEP GOAL:
Conduct a thorough audit of existing brand materials, messaging, and positioning to identify strengths, gaps, and inconsistencies that will inform the new brand voice framework.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Review Existing Materials
Ask the user to share or describe any existing materials:
- Website copy and messaging
- Previous pitch decks or investor presentations
- Marketing collateral (brochures, one-pagers, ads)
- Social media presence and content
- Email communications or newsletters
- Press releases or media coverage

### 2. Messaging Consistency Analysis
For each material reviewed, assess with the user:
- **Voice consistency**: Does the tone stay consistent across touchpoints?
- **Value proposition clarity**: Is the core message clear and repeated?
- **Audience alignment**: Does the language match the target investor profile?
- **Differentiation**: What stands out vs. competitors in the same space?

### 3. Identify Gaps and Opportunities
Work with the user to identify:
- Where is the brand voice strongest? Why?
- Where does it feel inconsistent or generic?
- What emotions does the current brand evoke?
- What emotions SHOULD it evoke?

### 4. Competitive Voice Positioning
Ask the user to identify 2-3 direct competitors and discuss:
- How do competitors position themselves to investors?
- What voice/tone do they use?
- Where is there white space for differentiation?

### 5. Document Audit Findings
Compile the audit findings into the following sections:
- **Current State Summary**: What exists today
- **Strengths**: What is working well
- **Gaps**: What is missing or inconsistent
- **Opportunities**: Where differentiation is possible

### Save Progress
Append audit findings to the working output file.
