# Step 4: Tone Matrix

## STEP GOAL:
Build a tone variation matrix that maps how the brand voice adapts across different communication contexts, audiences, and scenarios while maintaining core attribute consistency.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Explain Tone vs. Voice
Clarify the distinction for the user:
- **Voice** is WHO you are (consistent, defined in Step 3)
- **Tone** is HOW you say it in a given context (variable)
- The voice attributes remain constant; tone dials them up or down

### 2. Define Communication Contexts
Work with the user to identify key contexts where tone shifts:
- **Offering Announcement**: Initial public communication about the raise
- **Investor Education**: Explaining the opportunity, risks, and structure
- **Urgency/Deadline**: Time-sensitive communications (closing dates, milestones)
- **Performance Updates**: Reporting results, progress, or setbacks
- **Compliance/Legal**: Required disclosures and regulatory language
- **Relationship Building**: Ongoing engagement, newsletters, community updates
- **Crisis/Negative News**: Addressing problems, delays, or market headwinds

### 3. Build the Tone Matrix
For each context, define with the user:
- **Tone Descriptor**: 1-2 words (e.g., "Urgent but measured")
- **Dial Adjustments**: Which voice attributes dial up or down
- **Example Phrase**: A sample sentence showing this tone in action
- **What to Avoid**: Specific tone traps for this context

### 4. Audience-Specific Tone Variations
If investor segmentation exists, map tone adjustments for:
- Accredited/Institutional investors vs. Retail investors
- First-time investors vs. Experienced investors
- Early-stage interest vs. Ready-to-commit investors

### 5. Tone Decision Framework
Create a simple decision tree the user can reference:
- Given context X and audience Y, what tone should be applied?
- What are the non-negotiable tone rules (e.g., "Never sound desperate")?

### Save Progress
Append the tone matrix, audience variations, and decision framework to the working output file.
