# Step 5: Visual Identity

## STEP GOAL:
Establish visual identity language guidelines that complement the brand voice, ensuring visual elements reinforce messaging and create a cohesive investor experience.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Visual Identity Inventory
Ask the user about existing visual assets:
- **Logo**: Current logo, variations, usage rules
- **Color Palette**: Primary and secondary colors, hex codes if known
- **Typography**: Fonts used in materials, hierarchy preferences
- **Photography/Imagery Style**: Types of images used, stock vs. custom
- **Iconography**: Any custom icons or illustration style
- **Layout Patterns**: Preferred document layouts, grid systems

### 2. Visual-Voice Alignment
Map visual elements to voice attributes:
- How should each voice attribute (from Step 3) manifest visually?
- Example: "Authoritative" might map to clean layouts, serif headers, muted tones
- Example: "Innovative" might map to bold colors, modern sans-serif, dynamic imagery
- Identify any disconnects between current visuals and desired voice

### 3. Visual Tone Guidelines
Define visual treatment for key communication contexts:
- **Data Presentation**: Chart styles, color coding, data visualization approach
- **Document Headers/Footers**: Standard elements, branding placement
- **Compliance Callouts**: How to visually distinguish required disclosures
- **Call-to-Action Design**: Button styles, emphasis techniques, urgency indicators

### 4. Photography and Imagery Direction
Work with the user to establish:
- Image style preferences (documentary, aspirational, technical, human-centered)
- Subject matter guidelines (what to show, what to avoid)
- Diversity and representation standards
- Stock photography vs. custom photography guidance

### 5. Visual Do's and Don'ts
Create a quick-reference list:
- **Always**: Visual elements that reinforce the brand
- **Never**: Visual choices that undermine credibility or voice
- **Investor-Specific**: Visual standards particular to investor communications

### Save Progress
Append visual identity guidelines to the working output file.
