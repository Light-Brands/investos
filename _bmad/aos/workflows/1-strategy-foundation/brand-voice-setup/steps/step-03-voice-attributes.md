# Step 3: Voice Attributes

## STEP GOAL:
Define the core voice attributes that form the foundation of the brand personality. These attributes will guide all content creation and communication decisions.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Introduce Voice Attribute Framework
Explain the concept to the user:
- Voice attributes are the consistent personality traits of the brand
- They remain constant regardless of channel or context
- Typically 3-5 core attributes that work together as a system
- Each attribute has a spectrum (e.g., "Professional" is not the same as "Formal")

### 2. Voice Attribute Discovery
Guide the user through selecting core attributes using these dimensions:
- **Authority Spectrum**: Expert vs. Approachable vs. Peer
- **Emotion Spectrum**: Passionate vs. Measured vs. Reserved
- **Complexity Spectrum**: Sophisticated vs. Clear vs. Simple
- **Formality Spectrum**: Formal vs. Conversational vs. Casual
- **Energy Spectrum**: Bold vs. Confident vs. Steady

### 3. Define Each Attribute
For each selected attribute (target 3-5), document:
- **Attribute Name**: One-word label (e.g., "Authoritative")
- **Definition**: What this means for the brand in 1-2 sentences
- **This, Not That**: Clarify what it IS vs. what it IS NOT
  - Example: "Confident, not arrogant. Knowledgeable, not condescending."
- **In Practice**: A brief example of how this shows up in investor copy

### 4. Brand Personality Statement
Work with the user to craft a 2-3 sentence brand personality statement that weaves all attributes together. This becomes the north star for all voice decisions.

### 5. Voice Do's and Don'ts
Create a quick-reference list:
- **Always**: Behaviors and language that embody the voice
- **Never**: Behaviors and language that violate the voice
- **Watch Out For**: Common pitfalls specific to this brand

### Save Progress
Append voice attributes, personality statement, and do's/don'ts to the working output file.
