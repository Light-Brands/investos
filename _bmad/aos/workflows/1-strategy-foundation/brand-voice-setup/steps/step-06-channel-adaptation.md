# Step 6: Channel Adaptation

## STEP GOAL:
Define how the brand voice adapts across each communication channel while maintaining consistency. Each channel has unique constraints and audience expectations that require thoughtful adaptation.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Identify Active Channels
Confirm with the user which channels will be used for investor communications:
- Offering circular / SEC filings
- Investor pitch deck
- Email campaigns (drip sequences, updates, announcements)
- Video content (explainers, founder stories, testimonials)
- Landing pages (offering page, about page, FAQ)
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, other)
- Webinars and live presentations
- Press releases and media outreach
- Physical materials (if applicable)

### 2. Channel-Specific Voice Guidelines
For each active channel, define:
- **Character Limits/Constraints**: Practical limitations of the channel
- **Audience Mindset**: What is the audience expecting when they encounter this channel?
- **Voice Dial Adjustments**: How do core voice attributes flex for this channel?
- **Content Format**: Preferred structure (short-form, long-form, visual-heavy, etc.)
- **CTA Approach**: How calls-to-action should be handled on this channel
- **Compliance Considerations**: Channel-specific regulatory requirements

### 3. Cross-Channel Consistency Rules
Establish rules that apply across all channels:
- Key phrases or taglines that must appear consistently
- Messaging hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary messages)
- Brand name usage and abbreviation rules
- Terminology standards (consistent use of industry terms)
- Disclaimer and disclosure placement standards

### 4. Channel Priority and Sequencing
Work with the user to establish:
- Which channels are highest priority for the campaign?
- What is the typical investor journey across channels?
- How do channels reinforce each other?
- What is the content creation order for maximum efficiency?

### 5. Channel-Specific Examples
For the top 3 priority channels, draft a brief example showing:
- A sample headline or opening line
- How the voice attributes manifest in that channel
- How tone shifts from the default for that channel
