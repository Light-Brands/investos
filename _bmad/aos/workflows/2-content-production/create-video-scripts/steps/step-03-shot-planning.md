# Step 3: Shot Planning

## STEP GOAL:
Plan the visual shots, camera directions, B-roll needs, and production logistics for each video, providing enough detail for a production team or self-production to execute effectively.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Shot List Development
For each video, create a shot list with the user:
| Shot # | Description | Type | Duration | Audio | Notes |
|--------|------------|------|----------|-------|-------|

Shot types to consider:
- **Talking Head**: Speaker on camera
- **B-Roll**: Supplementary footage
- **Screen Recording**: Product demo or interface
- **Graphics/Animation**: Motion graphics, charts, text
- **Lifestyle**: People using product or in relevant settings
- **Location**: Office, venue, or context-setting shots

### 2. Camera and Framing Direction
Define camera direction for key shots:
- Framing (close-up, medium, wide)
- Camera movement (static, pan, track, handheld)
- Interview framing (rule of thirds, centered)
- Lighting direction (natural, studio, mixed)
- Background preferences

### 3. B-Roll Planning
Identify supplementary footage needs:
- What B-roll will be needed to cover narration?
- Can existing footage or stock footage be used?
- What custom B-roll needs to be shot?
- Product or service demonstration footage
- Team or workplace footage
- Customer or market footage

### 4. Graphics and Animation Needs
Define motion graphics requirements:
- Title cards and lower thirds
- Data visualization animations
- Logo animations
- Transition graphics
- On-screen text animations
- Compliance disclaimer animations

### 5. Music and Audio Direction
Define audio requirements:
- Background music style and mood
- Licensed music vs. royalty-free
- Sound effects needs
- Audio quality requirements (lapel mic, boom, ambient)
- Music licensing considerations

### 6. Production Logistics
Work with the user on practical planning:
- Location scouting needs
- Talent preparation (coaching, wardrobe)
- Equipment list
- Production schedule estimate
- Post-production timeline
- Editing style and pacing direction

### Save Progress
Append shot planning to the working output file.
