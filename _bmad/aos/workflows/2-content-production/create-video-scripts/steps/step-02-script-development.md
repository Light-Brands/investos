# Step 2: Script Development

## STEP GOAL:
Develop complete scripts for each planned video, including dialogue, narration, on-screen text, timing, and compliance elements -- working through each video type selected in Step 1.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Script Format Standards
Establish the script format with the user:
- Two-column format: Audio (left) | Visual (right)
- Timing annotations for each section
- Speaker identification for dialogue
- On-screen text callouts
- Music and sound effect cues
- Compliance disclosure placement markers

### 2. Script Development (Per Video)
For each video planned, work with the user to develop:

**Script Header**
- Video title and type
- Target duration
- Target audience
- Primary message
- Call to action

**Opening (First 5-10 seconds)**
- Hook that stops scrolling or captures attention
- Establish context immediately
- Brand identification

**Body (Core Content)**
- Key messages in priority order
- Supporting evidence or proof points
- Transitions between sections
- Emotional beats and pacing
- Data or statistic callouts

**Closing (Last 10-15 seconds)**
- Summary of key message
- Clear call-to-action
- Compliance disclaimers (verbal and/or on-screen)
- Brand and contact information

### 3. Dialogue and Narration
For each script section:
- Write natural, conversational dialogue (not reading from a teleprompter feel)
- Match brand voice attributes
- Keep sentences short (spoken word is different from written word)
- Include pronunciation guides for technical terms
- Note emphasis points and pauses

### 4. On-Screen Text and Graphics
Define text overlays for each script:
- Key statistics or data points
- Important terms or names
- URL or investment page address
- Disclaimer text (timing and placement)
- Lower thirds for speakers

### 5. Compliance Integration
For each script, ensure:
- Required disclaimers are scripted (verbal and/or visual)
- Risk disclosures are included proportionate to opportunity claims
- No unsubstantiated performance claims
- Testimonial disclosures included where applicable
- Forward-looking statement qualifiers present
- Reference compliance framework for specific language

### 6. Script Review
Review each completed script with the user:
- Read aloud for natural flow
- Verify timing against target duration (approx. 150 words per minute)
- Confirm key messages are clear
- Verify compliance elements are present

### Save Progress
Append all developed scripts to the working output file.
