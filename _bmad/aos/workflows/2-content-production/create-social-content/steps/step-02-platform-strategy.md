# Step 2: Platform Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Define a platform-specific strategy for each active social channel, including content approach, audience targeting, posting guidelines, and compliance requirements unique to each platform.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|

### 2. Platform-Specific Strategy
For each active platform, define with the user:

**LinkedIn**
- Profile optimization (company page, personal profiles)
- Content types (articles, posts, videos, documents, polls)
- Audience targeting (industry, title, company size)
- Posting frequency and optimal timing
- Hashtag strategy
- Employee advocacy approach
- LinkedIn-specific compliance notes

**Twitter/X**
- Profile optimization and bio
- Content types (tweets, threads, spaces, video)
- Hashtag and topic strategy
- Engagement strategy (replies, retweets, quote tweets)
- Posting frequency and timing
- Character limit approaches for compliance disclaimers

**Instagram**
- Profile optimization and link-in-bio strategy
- Content types (posts, stories, reels, carousels)
- Visual aesthetic and brand consistency
- Hashtag strategy
- Story highlights organization
- Instagram-specific compliance (no direct investment links in posts)

**Facebook**
- Page optimization
- Content types (posts, videos, events, groups)

**YouTube**
- Channel optimization and SEO
- Video content strategy (aligned with video scripts workflow)
- Thumbnail and title strategy
- Description and tag optimization
- Community tab content

### 3. Content Pillar Framework
Define content pillars with the user (typically 4-6):
- **Pillar 1**: {e.g., "Market Education" -- industry insights and trends}
- **Pillar 2**: {e.g., "Company Updates" -- milestones, progress, behind-the-scenes}
- **Pillar 3**: {e.g., "Investment Opportunity" -- offering details, terms, CTA}
- **Pillar 4**: {e.g., "Social Proof" -- testimonials, press, traction}
- **Pillar 5**: {e.g., "Team & Culture" -- human side of the company}
- Distribution ratio across pillars (e.g., 30/25/20/15/10)

### 4. Platform Compliance Rules
For each platform, define:
- Required disclaimers (full text or link to disclosure page)
- Character limit strategies for including compliance language
- Investment promotion rules specific to the platform
- How to handle direct messages about the offering
- Screenshot and sharing considerations

### 5. Engagement Strategy
Define engagement approach:
- Response time targets for comments and messages
- Approved response guidelines for investment questions
- Escalation triggers (when to stop and consult compliance)
- Community management dos and don'ts
