# Step 4: Post Drafting

## STEP GOAL:
Draft the actual social media posts for each platform, following the content calendar, applying brand voice, and integrating compliance requirements into each post.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Post Drafting Framework
For each post, work with the user to create:
- **Date and Platform**: When and where this posts
- **Content Pillar**: Which pillar this serves
- **Post Copy**: Full text of the post
- **Visual Direction**: What image, graphic, or video accompanies
- **Hashtags**: Platform-appropriate hashtag set
- **CTA**: What action the reader should take
- **Link**: URL (if applicable) with UTM parameters
- **Compliance**: Required disclaimers or link to disclosure
- **Alt Text**: Accessibility text for images

### 2. Platform-Specific Post Format

**LinkedIn Posts**
- Open with a hook (first 2 lines visible before "see more")
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include relevant hashtags (3-5)
- Tag relevant people or companies where appropriate
- Include compliance disclaimer or link

**Twitter/X Posts**
- Stay within character limits (280 for tweets)
- Thread format for longer content (opening tweet is the hook)
- Use relevant hashtags (1-2)
- Include shortened compliance link
- Quote tweet format for sharing content

**Instagram Posts**
- Focus on visual-first content
- Caption with hook in first line
- Hashtags in first comment or end of caption (15-30)
- Include compliance note in caption
- Call out link-in-bio for investment pages

**Instagram Stories/Reels**
- Short, attention-grabbing content
- Text overlay specifications
- Swipe-up or link sticker direction
- Story sequence structure (if multi-story)
- Compliance overlay requirements

### 3. Draft Posts by Calendar Week
Work through the content calendar systematically:
- Draft all posts for Week 1 first
- Review with the user before proceeding to Week 2
- Ensure variety and flow across the week
- Check that content pillars are balanced

### 4. Visual Asset Requirements
For each post, document:
- Image specifications (dimensions, format)
- Image source (existing, stock, custom, screenshot)
- Design elements needed (text overlay, branding, data visualization)
- Video specifications if applicable (duration, format, captions)

### 5. Compliance Review Per Post
For each drafted post, verify:
- [ ] No unsubstantiated claims
- [ ] No guaranteed returns language
- [ ] Disclaimer or disclosure link included
- [ ] Consistent with offering document
- [ ] Platform-specific compliance rules followed
- [ ] Not misleading in isolation (even without reading the link)
