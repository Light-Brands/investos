# Step 3: Content Calendar

## STEP GOAL:
Build a detailed content calendar that maps what to post, when to post, on which platform, aligned with content pillars, campaign milestones, and the overall investor journey timeline.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Calendar Duration and Framework
Establish the calendar scope with the user:
- Calendar duration (2 weeks, 1 month, full campaign)
- Posting frequency per platform
- Content pillar distribution across the week
- Key dates and milestones (offering launch, deadlines, events)

### 2. Weekly Posting Schedule
Create a weekly template:
| Day | Platform | Pillar | Content Type | Theme/Topic |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|

Example weekly rhythm:
- Monday: LinkedIn -- Market Education (article or insight)
- Tuesday: Twitter/X -- Company Update (milestone or progress)
- Wednesday: Instagram -- Behind-the-Scenes (team or culture)
- Thursday: LinkedIn -- Investment Opportunity (offering detail)
- Friday: Twitter/X -- Social Proof (testimonial or press)
- Weekend: Instagram Stories -- Casual/personal content

### 3. Campaign Phase Alignment
Map content intensity to campaign phases:

**Pre-Launch Phase**
- Build awareness and audience
- Tease the opportunity
- Establish expertise and credibility
- Content ratio: Education heavy, minimal CTA

**Launch Phase**
- Announce the offering
- Drive traffic to offering page
- Share initial traction
- Content ratio: Balanced education and CTA

**Momentum Phase**
- Share social proof and milestones
- Address common questions and objections
- Create urgency with progress updates
- Content ratio: Social proof and CTA heavy

**Closing Phase**
- Final push messaging
- Deadline-driven urgency
- Thank early investors
- Content ratio: CTA and urgency heavy

### 4. Detailed Content Calendar
Build out the full calendar:
| Date | Platform | Pillar | Content Type | Topic | CTA | Status |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|-----|--------|

### 5. Content Repurposing Plan
Define how to maximize content across platforms:
- Long-form LinkedIn article > Twitter thread > Instagram carousel
- Video content > Short clips > GIFs > Still images with quotes
- Blog posts > Social snippets > Email content
- Customer stories > Multiple format treatments

### 6. Holiday and Awareness Calendar
Note relevant dates:
- Industry-relevant awareness days or events
- Holidays that affect posting (avoid or leverage)
- Competitor events or launches to be aware of
- Market events that could affect sentiment
