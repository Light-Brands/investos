# Step 2: Audience Mapping

## STEP GOAL:
Map investor audience segments to specific email sequences, defining segment-specific messaging, personalization approach, and entry/exit triggers for each audience group.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Segment Review
If investor segmentation exists, review with the user:
- Which segments will receive email communications?
- Are all segments on the same sequence or different ones?
- What is the priority order for segment-specific content?

If no segmentation exists, work with the user to identify at minimum:
- Warm leads vs. cold prospects
- Accredited vs. non-accredited investors
- High-intent vs. early-interest contacts

### 2. Segment-Specific Messaging
For each audience segment, define:
- **Lead Message**: Primary value proposition for this segment
- **Pain Points**: What concerns need to be addressed?
- **Proof Points**: What evidence resonates most?
- **Tone Adjustment**: How should voice flex for this segment?
- **CTA Approach**: What action do we want them to take?

### 3. Entry Triggers
Define how contacts enter each email sequence:
- Website sign-up or interest form
- Event attendance or webinar registration
- Referral or introduction
- Platform account creation
- Advertising response
- Manual addition by sales team

### 4. Exit and Suppression Rules
Define when contacts should exit or be suppressed:
- Invested (move to post-investment sequence)
- Unsubscribed
- Hard bounce
- Explicit disinterest
- Regulatory restriction (geographic, accreditation)

### 5. Personalization Strategy
Define personalization approach:
- What merge fields will be used (name, company, investment amount)?
- What dynamic content blocks will vary by segment?
- How will subject lines be personalized?
- What behavioral triggers will customize the experience?

### 6. Audience-Sequence Matrix
Create the mapping:
| Segment | Sequence Type | Entry Trigger | Personalization | Priority |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
