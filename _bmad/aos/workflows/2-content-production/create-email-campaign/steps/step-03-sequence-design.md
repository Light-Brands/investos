# Step 3: Sequence Design

## STEP GOAL:
Design the email sequence architecture, defining the number of emails, timing/cadence, purpose of each email in the sequence, and how sequences connect to the broader investor journey.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Sequence Architecture
Design the overall sequence structure with the user:
- How many emails in the primary sequence?
- What is the cadence (days between emails)?
- Are there branching paths based on behavior (opened, clicked, replied)?
- Are there conditional sends based on segment?

### 2. Email Purpose Mapping
For each email in the sequence, define:
| Email # | Day | Subject Theme | Purpose | Primary CTA |
|---------|-----|--------------|---------|-------------|

Common sequence patterns:
**Awareness/Education Sequence (5-7 emails)**
1. Welcome + introduction to opportunity
2. Problem/market pain point
3. Solution and value proposition
4. Social proof / traction / credibility
5. How the investment works
6. FAQ and objection handling
7. Invitation to invest / next step

**Conversion Sequence (3-5 emails)**
1. Time-sensitive opportunity announcement
2. Key details and terms
3. Social proof and urgency
4. Final reminder and CTA
5. Last chance / deadline

**Nurture Sequence (ongoing)**
1. Market update or industry insight
2. Company milestone or progress
3. Educational content
4. Community or investor spotlight
5. Periodic investment reminder

### 3. Subject Line Strategy
Discuss subject line approach with the user:
- Personalized vs. generic subject lines
- A/B testing strategy for subject lines
- Character length targets
- Preview text strategy
- Subject line themes for each email

### 4. Timing and Send Optimization
Define sending parameters:
- Best day(s) of the week for investor emails
- Best time of day for sends
- Time zone considerations
- Frequency caps (max emails per week)
- Holiday and blackout date awareness

### 5. Behavioral Triggers
Define behavioral automation rules:
- What happens if someone opens but does not click?
- What happens if someone clicks but does not convert?
- What happens if someone does not open any emails?
- Re-engagement sequence triggers
- Escalation to personal outreach triggers
