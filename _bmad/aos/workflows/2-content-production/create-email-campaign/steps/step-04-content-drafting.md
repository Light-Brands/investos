# Step 4: Content Drafting

## STEP GOAL:
Draft the complete content for each email in the sequence, including subject lines, preview text, body copy, calls-to-action, and footer elements -- all aligned with brand voice and compliance requirements.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Email Content Template
For each email, work with the user to draft:

**Header Elements**
- Subject Line (primary)
- Subject Line (A/B variant)
- Preview Text (40-90 characters)
- From Name
- Reply-To address

**Body Content**
- Opening hook (first 2-3 sentences -- most critical)
- Body copy (supporting the email's purpose)
- Data points or proof elements
- Primary CTA (button text and destination URL)
- Secondary CTA (if applicable)
- P.S. line (optional but effective)

**Footer Elements**
- Required disclaimers
- Unsubscribe link
- Company information (address, contact)
- Social media links
- Regulatory notices

### 2. Draft Each Email
Work through each email sequentially:
- Reference the purpose and theme from Step 3
- Apply brand voice guidelines
- Keep emails focused on one primary message
- Write for scannability (short paragraphs, bullet points, bold key phrases)
- Include personalization merge fields where appropriate
- Target word count: 150-300 words for body copy

### 3. CTA Optimization
For each email's call-to-action:
- Use action-oriented language
- Create visual distinction (button vs. text link)
- Ensure CTA destination is clear
- Consider the investor's readiness level at this point in the sequence
- Primary CTA above the fold when possible

### 4. Email-to-Email Transitions
Ensure narrative flow across the sequence:
- Does each email build on the previous?
- Are callbacks to previous emails natural?
- Does the urgency/energy progression feel right?
- Is the CTA escalation appropriate?

### 5. Segment-Specific Variations
For emails that vary by segment:
- Draft the base version first
- Note which sections need segment-specific content
- Draft variations for each segment
- Ensure all variations maintain compliance

### Save Progress
Append all drafted email content to the working output file.
