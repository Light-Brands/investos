# Step 5: Investor FAQ

## STEP GOAL:
Build a comprehensive investor FAQ document that addresses the financial questions investors most commonly ask, with clear, honest, and compliant answers.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Question Collection
Work with the user to identify the most common investor questions:

**About the Offering**
- How much are you raising and why?
- What is the minimum investment?
- What do I get for my investment (rights, returns)?
- How long until I see a return?
- Can I sell my shares/units?
- What are the tax implications?

**About the Financials**
- Are you profitable? If not, when?
- What is your burn rate and runway?
- How are you currently funded?
- What were your last 12 months of revenue?
- What are your revenue projections?
- How do you plan to use the money raised?

**About the Business**
- What is your competitive advantage?
- Who are your competitors?
- What are the biggest risks?
- What happens if you do not raise the full amount?
- What is your exit strategy?
- How does management get compensated?

**About the Process**
- How do I invest?
- Is my investment protected?
- What reporting will I receive?
- Who else has invested?
- What happens after I invest?

### 2. Answer Development
For each question, work with the user to draft:
- **Short Answer**: 1-2 sentence direct answer
- **Extended Answer**: 1-2 paragraph detailed explanation
- **Supporting Data**: Relevant metric or proof point
- **Compliance Note**: Any required qualifiers or disclaimers
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to relevant section of offering document

### 3. Answer Review for Compliance
For each answer, verify:
- Is the answer accurate and verifiable?
- Are there any forward-looking statements that need qualification?
- Are risk factors adequately referenced?
- Is the answer consistent with the offering document?
- Are required disclaimers included?

### 4. FAQ Organization
Organize the FAQ document:
- Group by category (offering, financials, business, process)
- Order within categories by frequency of question
- Create a table of contents with anchor links
- Include a "still have questions" section with contact information

### 5. FAQ Distribution Plan
Discuss with the user where the FAQ will be used:
