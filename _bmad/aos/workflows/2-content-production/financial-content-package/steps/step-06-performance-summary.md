# Step 6: Performance Summary

## STEP GOAL:
Create a clear, compelling performance summary that presents the company's financial and operational performance to investors with appropriate context, comparisons, and honest assessment.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Performance Period Definition
Confirm with the user:
- What period does this performance summary cover?
- What comparison period is being used (prior year, prior quarter)?
- Are there any material events during the period to highlight?
- Is this a regular update or for a specific purpose (offering, annual report)?

### 2. Financial Performance Highlights
Work with the user to present:

**Revenue Performance**
- Total revenue for the period
- Revenue growth vs. comparison period
- Revenue breakdown by segment/product
- Revenue vs. projections or budget (if disclosed)
- Commentary on revenue drivers and trends

**Profitability Performance**

### 3. Operational Performance
Present operational highlights:

### 4. Performance Narrative
Craft the narrative wrapper for the data:
- Opening paragraph: Period headline and overall assessment
- What went well and why
- What was challenging and why
- How challenges are being addressed
- Connection to long-term strategy and investor thesis

### 5. Performance Comparison Table
Create a clear comparison:
| Metric | Current Period | Prior Period | Change | Commentary |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|------------|

### 6. Balanced Disclosure
Ensure the performance summary is balanced:
- Positive developments are supported by data
