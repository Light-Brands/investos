# Step 4: Key Metrics

## STEP GOAL:
Define the key metrics dashboard that will be used across investor communications, including metric definitions, presentation format, benchmarks, and narrative context for each metric.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Metric Selection
Work with the user to select 8-12 key metrics for the dashboard:

**Financial Health Metrics**
- Revenue (total and growth rate)
- Gross margin
- Operating margin or EBITDA margin
- Cash position and burn rate
- Runway

**Growth Metrics**
- Revenue growth rate (MoM, QoQ, YoY)
- Customer/user growth rate
- Market expansion indicators
- Pipeline or backlog

**Efficiency Metrics**
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV/CAC ratio
- Revenue per employee
- Capital efficiency ratio

**Business Health Metrics**
- Net revenue retention
- Churn rate
- Engagement or usage metrics
- Customer satisfaction scores

### 2. Metric Definitions
For each selected metric, document:
- **Metric Name**: Clear, standard name
- **Definition**: Precisely how it is calculated
- **Data Source**: Where the number comes from
- **Reporting Frequency**: How often it is updated
- **Why It Matters**: Why investors should care about this metric

### 3. Metric Presentation
For each metric, define the presentation approach:
- **Display Format**: Number, percentage, ratio, currency
- **Trend Direction**: Up is good, down is good, or neutral
- **Visualization Type**: Gauge, line chart, bar chart, big number
- **Comparison Point**: Industry benchmark, previous period, target
- **Red/Yellow/Green Thresholds**: Performance indicators

### 4. Benchmark Context
For each metric, establish context with the user:
- How does this metric compare to industry averages?
- How does it compare to competitors (if data is available)?
- What would "good" look like for a company at this stage?
- What trajectory is being targeted?

### 5. Dashboard Layout
Design the metrics dashboard layout:
- **Executive Summary Row**: Top 3-4 headline metrics
- **Financial Detail Row**: Revenue, margins, cash position
- **Growth Detail Row**: Growth rates and momentum indicators
- **Efficiency Detail Row**: Unit economics and capital efficiency
- **Trend Section**: Key metrics over time

### 6. Non-GAAP and Adjusted Metrics
If using non-GAAP or adjusted metrics:
- Clearly label each as non-GAAP
- Provide reconciliation to GAAP equivalent
- Explain why the non-GAAP metric is useful
- Include required disclaimers

### Save Progress
Append key metrics dashboard to the working output file.
