# Step 7: Forward Guidance

## STEP GOAL:
Develop forward-looking guidance content that communicates the company's expected trajectory, goals, and projections with appropriate qualifications, safe harbor language, and risk context.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Forward Guidance Framework
Discuss with the user the approach to forward-looking content:
- What is the company comfortable projecting or guiding?
- What time horizon for guidance (next quarter, 12 months, 3 years)?
- Will specific numbers be provided or directional commentary only?
- What assumptions underlie any projections?
- What are the key risks to achieving projections?

### 2. Revenue Guidance
Work with the user on revenue outlook:
- Expected revenue trajectory (range or directional)
- Revenue growth rate expectations
- New revenue stream introductions
- Customer acquisition targets
- Market expansion plans
- Assumptions and dependencies

### 3. Operational Milestones
Define upcoming operational milestones:
- Product development timeline and launches
- Market entry dates
- Partnership or deal expectations
- Hiring and team growth plans
- Infrastructure or capacity expansion
- Regulatory milestones expected

### 4. Financial Targets
Document financial targets with the user:
- Profitability timeline
- Margin improvement targets
- Capital efficiency goals
- Cash flow breakeven expectations
- Fundraising plans beyond current offering

### 5. Risk Context for Forward Guidance
For each forward-looking element, document:
- What could cause actual results to differ?
- What are the key assumptions?
- What external factors could change the outlook?
- What is the downside scenario?

### 6. Safe Harbor Language
Ensure all forward-looking content includes:
- Clear identification of forward-looking statements
- Safe harbor disclaimer language
- Specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ
- Statement that projections are not guarantees
- Reference to full risk factors in offering document

### 7. Guidance Presentation
Package the forward guidance:
- Executive summary of outlook
- Key milestones timeline
- Financial targets table (with clear "projected" labels)
- Risk factor summary specific to projections
- Safe harbor statement
