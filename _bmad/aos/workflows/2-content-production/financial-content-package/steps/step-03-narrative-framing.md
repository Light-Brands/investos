# Step 3: Narrative Framing

## STEP GOAL:
Develop the overarching financial narrative that will frame all financial content -- turning raw data into a coherent story that investors can understand, believe, and act upon.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Financial Story Arc
Work with the user to define the core financial narrative:
- **Where We Started**: The financial starting point
- **Where We Are**: Current financial position and highlights
- **Where We Are Going**: Financial trajectory and goals
- **How We Get There**: The path from current state to future state
- **Why It Matters to Investors**: The investment thesis in financial terms

### 2. Headline Metrics
Identify the 3-5 headline numbers that tell the story:
- What is the single most impressive financial metric?
- What metric best demonstrates momentum or growth?
- What metric best addresses the biggest investor concern?
- What metric best differentiates from competitors?
- What metric best shows responsible financial management?

### 3. Narrative Themes
Define the key themes that will run through all financial content:
- **Growth Theme**: How is the company growing and at what rate?
- **Efficiency Theme**: How well is capital being deployed?
- **Sustainability Theme**: How durable is the business model?
- **Opportunity Theme**: How big is the financial opportunity?
- **Prudence Theme**: How responsibly is the company managed?

### 4. Data-to-Narrative Translation
For each key data point, work with the user to create:
- **The Number**: Raw data point
- **The Context**: Why this number matters
- **The Comparison**: Benchmark or comparison point
- **The Narrative**: One-sentence story this number tells
- **The Implication**: What it means for investors

### 5. Narrative Guardrails
Establish what the financial narrative must NOT do:
- Overstate growth or performance
- Minimize legitimate risks or challenges
- Make promises about future performance
- Omit material negative information
- Create misleading impressions through selective data presentation
- Use accounting metrics inconsistently

### 6. Audience-Adapted Narratives
If serving multiple investor segments, discuss:
- How does the narrative flex for sophisticated vs. retail investors?
- What level of financial detail does each audience need?
- Which metrics resonate with which segments?
- How to maintain accuracy while adjusting complexity
