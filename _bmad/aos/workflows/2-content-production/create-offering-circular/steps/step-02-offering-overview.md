# Step 2: Offering Overview

## STEP GOAL:
Draft the offering overview section, including a summary of terms, cover page information, and the executive summary that gives investors a clear, honest snapshot of the opportunity.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Cover Page Information
Gather and organize cover page elements:
- Issuer name, logo placement, and contact information
- Offering title and security description
- Maximum offering amount
- Price per share/unit
- Minimum investment amount
- Date of the circular
- Required legends and disclaimers (from compliance framework if available)

### 2. Summary of Terms Table
Work with the user to complete the terms summary:
- Securities offered and price
- Minimum and maximum offering amounts
- Use of proceeds (high-level summary)
- Investor eligibility requirements
- Offering period and closing conditions
- Transfer restrictions
- Dividend/distribution policy
- Voting rights
- Key risk factors (top 3-5)

### 3. Executive Summary Narrative
Guide the user through drafting a compelling but compliant executive summary:
- What is the company and what does it do?
- What is the investment opportunity?
- Why now? What makes this the right time?
- What are investors getting in return?
- What are the most important risks to understand?

### 4. Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer
Include the appropriate forward-looking statement safe harbor language:
- Reference compliance framework if available
- Ensure language is prominent and clear

### 5. Review and Refine
Present the drafted overview to the user:
- Is the tone appropriate (reference brand voice if available)?
- Are all terms accurate?
- Is anything missing that investors would expect to see first?
