# Step 11: Compliance Review

## STEP GOAL:
Perform a thorough compliance self-review of the entire draft offering document, identifying any issues that need to be addressed before submission to legal counsel for final review.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Anti-Fraud Review
Review the document for anti-fraud compliance:
- Are there any material misstatements of fact?
- Are there any material omissions?
- Are all claims supported by evidence?
- Are projections properly qualified?
- Is the overall impression of the document balanced (not misleadingly positive)?

### 2. Plain Language Review
Assess readability and clarity:
- Can a sophisticated but non-expert investor understand the document?
- Are technical terms defined or explained?
- Is legal jargon minimized where possible?
- Are complex structures explained in accessible language?
- Is the document organized logically for the reader?

### 3. Consistency Review
Check for internal consistency:
- Do all financial figures reconcile across sections?
- Are entity names and legal descriptions consistent?
- Are dates, timelines, and deadlines consistent?
- Does the risk factors section address risks mentioned elsewhere?
- Are all cross-references accurate?

### 4. Completeness Review
Verify completeness:
- Reference the disclosure checklist from Step 10
- Are all sections drafted to a reasonable level of detail?
- Are there placeholder items that need to be filled in?
- Is anything marked "TBD" or "to be provided"?

### 5. Brand Voice Alignment
If brand voice guidelines exist, review:
- Does the document voice align with established brand attributes?
- Is the tone appropriate for an offering document?
- Are brand-specific terms and phrases used correctly?

### 6. Issues Log
Compile all identified issues:
| Issue | Section | Severity | Action Required | Owner |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------|-------|
- Categorize as: Critical, Important, Minor, Cosmetic
- Assign ownership (user, legal counsel, accountant)

### 7. Legal Counsel Preparation
Prepare items for legal counsel review:
- Summary of document status
- List of open questions for counsel
- Areas where legal input is specifically needed
- Timeline for counsel review
