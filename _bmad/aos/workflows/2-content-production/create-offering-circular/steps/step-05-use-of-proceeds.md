# Step 5: Use of Proceeds

## STEP GOAL:
Define and present a clear, specific breakdown of how offering proceeds will be used, including allocation categories, priorities, and contingencies based on raise amounts.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Offering Costs
Work with the user to identify and quantify offering costs:
- Legal and accounting fees
- Filing fees (SEC, state)
- Platform or broker-dealer commissions and fees
- Marketing and advertising costs for the offering
- Escrow fees
- Other offering-related expenses
- Total estimated offering costs as a percentage of raise

### 2. Net Proceeds Allocation
For the net proceeds (after offering costs), define categories with the user:
- Each category with a dollar amount and percentage
- Narrative description of what each allocation will fund
- Timeline for when proceeds will be deployed
- Expected outcomes or milestones from each allocation

Common categories to explore:
- Product development / R&D
- Sales and marketing
- Working capital and operations
- Hiring and team expansion
- Capital expenditures / equipment
- Debt repayment
- General corporate purposes
- Reserve / contingency

### 3. Scenario Analysis
Present allocation under different raise scenarios:
- **Minimum Raise**: How will proceeds be allocated at minimum?
- **25% of Maximum**: Allocation at quarter of target
- **50% of Maximum**: Allocation at half of target
- **75% of Maximum**: Allocation at three-quarters
- **Maximum Raise**: Full allocation plan
- What activities are prioritized if the raise falls short?

### 4. Use of Proceeds Table
Create a clear table:
| Category | Amount | % of Proceeds | Description |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|

### 5. Important Disclosures
Ensure required disclosures are included:
- Management discretion statement (if applicable)
- Changes to allocation possibility statement
- Material spending in next 12 months disclosure
- Conflicts of interest in use of proceeds

### Save Progress
Append the use of proceeds section to the working output file.
