# Step 3: Content Wireframes

## STEP GOAL:
Create detailed content wireframes for each landing page, defining the section-by-section content structure, copy, imagery direction, and CTA placement for each page.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Content Wireframe Format
Establish the wireframe format with the user:
- Each page wireframed as a vertical sequence of content sections
- Each section includes: headline, body copy, visual direction, CTA (if any)
- Sections flow from top of page to bottom
- Mobile and desktop variations noted where relevant

### 2. Main Offering Page Wireframe
Build the primary landing page section by section:

**Hero Section**
- Headline (the most important statement on the page)
- Subheadline or supporting statement
- Primary CTA button
- Hero image or video direction
- Social proof element (raised amount, investor count, press logos)

**Problem / Opportunity Section**
- Why this matters (market pain or opportunity)
- Supporting data or statistics
- Visual representation

**Solution / Value Proposition Section**
- What the company offers
- Key differentiators (3-4 points)
- Visual or product imagery

**How It Works Section**
- Step-by-step investment process
- Timeline or milestone visual

**Footer CTA Section**
- Final call-to-action
- Urgency element (if applicable)
- Contact information
- Required disclaimers and disclosures

### 3. Additional Page Wireframes
For each additional page in the strategy, create wireframes:
- Follow the same section-by-section format
- Ensure consistency with the main page structure
- Define unique content for each page's purpose

### 4. Copy Drafting
For each section in each wireframe, work with the user to draft:
- Headlines (powerful, clear, benefit-driven)
- Body copy (concise, scannable, compelling)
- CTA button text (action-oriented)
- Image alt text and captions
- Compliance disclaimers per section

### 5. Visual Direction Per Section
For each section, note:
- Image or graphic type needed
- Layout direction (left-right, centered, full-width)
- Background treatment
- Typography emphasis
- Animation or interaction notes
