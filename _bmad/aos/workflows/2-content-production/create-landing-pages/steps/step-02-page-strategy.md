# Step 2: Page Strategy

## STEP GOAL:
Define the overall landing page strategy, including how many pages are needed, what each page's purpose is, how pages connect to each other and to the investor journey, and how the site architecture supports conversion.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Page Inventory
Work with the user to define the pages needed:

**Core Pages (typically required)**
- **Main Offering Page**: Primary landing page for the investment opportunity
- **How It Works**: Explains the investment process step-by-step
- **About / Team**: Company story and leadership
- **FAQ**: Answers common investor questions

**Additional Pages (based on needs)**
- **Risk Factors / Disclaimers**: Dedicated disclosure page
- **Financial Details**: Key metrics and financial summary
- **Press / Media**: Coverage and press mentions
- **Contact**: How to reach the team
- **Thank You / Confirmation**: Post-conversion confirmation
- **Segment-Specific**: Pages tailored to specific investor segments

### 2. Page Hierarchy and Flow
Design the site architecture:
- What is the primary entry page for each traffic source?
- How do pages link to each other?
- What is the ideal visitor flow (entry > education > conversion)?
- Where does the conversion action happen (on-site or redirect to platform)?

### 3. Traffic Source Alignment
For each traffic source, define:
| Source | Entry Page | Visitor Intent | Desired Action |
|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
- Email campaigns > Dedicated landing page
- Social media > Overview or segment-specific page
- Paid advertising > High-conversion focused page
- Organic search > SEO-optimized content page
- Referrals > Trust-focused page

### 4. SEO Strategy
Discuss search optimization with the user:
- Target keywords for organic traffic
- Meta titles and descriptions for each page
- Header tag hierarchy strategy
- Internal linking plan
- Schema markup considerations

### 5. Mobile Strategy
Discuss mobile experience:
- Mobile-first design priority
- Mobile-specific content considerations
- Touch-friendly CTA design
- Mobile page speed targets
- Mobile-specific compliance display
