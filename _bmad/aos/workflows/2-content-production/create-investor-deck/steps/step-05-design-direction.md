# Step 5: Design Direction

## STEP GOAL:
Define the visual design direction for the deck, ensuring alignment with brand identity and creating a professional, credible presentation that reinforces the investment narrative.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Brand Alignment
Reference brand voice guidelines (if available) and confirm:
- Color palette for the deck
- Typography selections (header and body fonts)
- Logo placement and usage rules
- Overall visual tone (corporate, modern, bold, clean, etc.)

### 2. Slide Layout Principles
Establish layout guidelines with the user:
- **Grid System**: How content is organized on each slide
- **White Space**: Minimum margins and breathing room
- **Text Hierarchy**: How headline, subhead, and body relate
- **Image Placement**: Standard positions for visuals
- **Consistency Elements**: Header bar, footer, slide numbers, logo

### 3. Slide Type Templates
Define visual templates for common slide types:
- **Title Slide**: Full-bleed image? Minimal? Bold statement?
- **Content Slide**: Left/right split? Top title with body? Full text?
- **Data Slide**: Chart-dominant? Chart with context? Dashboard-style?
- **Team Slide**: Photos with bios? Grid layout? Featured individuals?
- **Quote/Testimonial Slide**: Large quote? Photo with attribution?
- **Section Divider**: How to visually separate major sections?

### 4. Photography and Imagery
Define image direction:
- Photography style (authentic, aspirational, technical, abstract)
- Image subjects and themes
- Stock vs. custom photography needs
- Illustration or icon style preferences
- Image treatment (full color, duotone, overlay, etc.)

### 5. Animation and Transition Guidance
For live presentation decks:
- Transition style between slides (simple, none, branded)
- Build-in approach for content (sequential reveals, all-at-once)
- Animation principles (subtle, purposeful, minimal)
- What should NOT be animated

### 6. Design Brief Summary
Compile a design brief that a designer could execute:
- Overall aesthetic description
- Color palette with hex codes
- Font specifications
- Layout templates
- Image direction
- File format and delivery requirements (PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, PDF)
