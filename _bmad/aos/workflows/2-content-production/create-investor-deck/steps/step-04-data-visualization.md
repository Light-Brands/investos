# Step 4: Data Visualization

## STEP GOAL:
Plan the data visualizations, charts, and infographics that will bring the deck's data points to life, ensuring they are clear, compelling, and honest.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Data Visualization Inventory
Review slide content from Step 3 and identify with the user:
- Which slides need charts or graphs?
- Which slides need infographics or diagrams?
- Which slides need icons or visual metaphors?
- Which slides are primarily image-driven?

### 2. Chart Type Selection
For each data visualization, determine the best format:
- **Bar Charts**: Comparing categories or showing rankings
- **Line Charts**: Showing trends over time
- **Pie/Donut Charts**: Showing composition (use sparingly)
- **Waterfall Charts**: Showing contribution or breakdown
- **Area Charts**: Showing cumulative values over time
- **Tables**: For precise numbers that must be exact
- **Infographics**: For processes, timelines, or comparisons

### 3. Data Specification
For each visualization, document with the user:
- **Data Source**: Where does this data come from?
- **Data Points**: Specific numbers to be visualized
- **Chart Type**: Selected visualization format
- **Key Takeaway**: What should the viewer conclude?
- **Labels and Annotations**: What callouts are needed?
- **Source Citation**: How should the data source be cited?

### 4. Visualization Principles
Establish guidelines with the user:
- **Honesty**: No misleading scales, cherry-picked data, or visual tricks
- **Clarity**: Can the chart be understood in 5 seconds?
- **Consistency**: Same color scheme and style across all charts
- **Accessibility**: Readable from the back of a room (if presented)
- **Compliance**: Financial projections must include appropriate disclaimers

### 5. Market Size Visualization
Special attention to the market opportunity slide:
- TAM/SAM/SOM representation approach
- Source citations for market data
- How to show the company's position within the market
- Growth trajectory visualization

### 6. Financial Projection Visualization
Special attention to financial slides:
- Revenue projection chart format
- Key metric trend visualization
- Unit economics representation
- Disclaimer and safe harbor placement on projection slides

### Save Progress
Append data visualization specifications to the working output file.
