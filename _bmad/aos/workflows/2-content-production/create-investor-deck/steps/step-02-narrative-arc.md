# Step 2: Narrative Arc

## STEP GOAL:
Design the overarching narrative arc that structures the deck, creating a compelling story that takes investors on a logical and emotional journey from problem to opportunity to action.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Story Framework Selection
Discuss narrative frameworks with the user:
- **Problem-Solution-Traction-Ask**: Classic startup pitch structure
- **Vision-Market-Product-Team-Ask**: Vision-led for bold ideas
- **Why Now-What-How-Proof-Ask**: Urgency-driven for market timing
- **Journey-Transformation-Evidence-Invitation**: Story-driven approach
- Or a hybrid approach based on the offering's strengths

### 2. Core Narrative Elements
Work with the user to define:
- **The Hook**: What grabs attention in the first 30 seconds?
- **The Problem**: What pain or gap exists in the market?
- **The Solution**: How does this offering address the problem?
- **The Proof**: What evidence validates the approach?
- **The Opportunity**: Why is this an attractive investment?
- **The Ask**: What are you inviting investors to do?

### 3. Slide Outline
Create the slide-by-slide outline with the user:
| Slide # | Title | Purpose | Key Message | Time (sec) |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|------------|

Typical structure (adjust to user's needs):
1. Title / Opening Hook
2. Problem / Market Pain
3. Solution / Value Proposition
4. Product / How It Works
5. Market Opportunity / TAM
6. Business Model / Revenue
7. Traction / Milestones
8. Competitive Advantage
9. Team
10. Financial Projections
11. The Offering / Terms
12. Use of Proceeds
13. Call to Action / Ask
14. Appendix (backup slides)

### 4. Emotional Journey Mapping
Map the emotional arc of the presentation:
- Where should the audience feel concern (problem)?
- Where should they feel excitement (solution/opportunity)?
- Where should they feel confidence (proof/team)?
- Where should they feel urgency (ask/timing)?

### 5. Narrative Consistency Check
Review the outline with the user:
- Does each slide build logically on the previous?
- Is there a clear "so what" for each slide?
- Does the narrative serve the target audience identified in Step 1?
- Are there any gaps in the logical flow?

### Save Progress
Append the narrative arc and slide outline to the working output file.
