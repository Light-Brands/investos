# Step 3: Slide Content

## STEP GOAL:
Draft the content for each slide in the deck, including headlines, body text, speaker notes, data points, and compliance disclosures -- working through the outline established in Step 2.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:
- NEVER generate content without user input
- YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding

## Sequence of Instructions

### 1. Slide Content Framework
For each slide, work with the user to develop:
- **Headline**: One powerful sentence that carries the slide's key message
- **Body Content**: Supporting points (3 max per slide, brief)
- **Data Points**: Specific numbers, metrics, or evidence to include
- **Visual Direction**: What image, chart, or graphic should accompany
- **Speaker Notes**: What the presenter should say (for live presentations)
- **Compliance Notes**: Any disclaimers or disclosures needed on this slide

### 2. Content Drafting (Slide by Slide)
Work through each slide from the outline sequentially:
- Draft the headline first -- it should be a complete thought
- Keep body text concise (no paragraphs on slides)
- Use the "one message per slide" principle
- Flag where data visualizations are needed (for Step 4)
- Note required compliance language per the compliance framework

### 3. Key Content Sections

**Opening Slides (Hook + Problem)**
- Create urgency or curiosity
- Use a statistic, question, or bold statement
- Make the problem relatable to the investor audience

**Middle Slides (Solution + Proof + Opportunity)**
- Focus on clarity and credibility
- Include specific metrics and evidence
- Show market size with credible sources
- Present traction with real data

**Closing Slides (Team + Terms + Ask)**
- Build confidence with team credentials
- Present offering terms clearly
- Make the ask specific and actionable
- End with energy and confidence

### 4. Speaker Notes Development
For presentation decks, draft speaker notes for each slide:
- What to say during this slide (key talking points)
- Transition language to the next slide
- Anticipated questions for this section
- Timing guidance

### 5. Content Review
Review all slide content with the user:
- Is the language consistent with brand voice guidelines?
- Are all claims substantiated?
- Is the content appropriate for the target audience?
- Does the flow match the narrative arc?

### Save Progress
Append all slide content to the working output file.
