trigger_pattern: "When an automated audit or sub-agent reports missing resources, broken references, or other defects"
lesson_core: "Always verify automated findings manually before acting on them. Sub-agents and scripts can have false positives due to pattern matching limitations. In the QI Phase 1 build, a sub-agent reported 5 missing agent manifest entries that actually existed — the grep pattern was too narrow. Manual verification took 10 seconds and prevented unnecessary remediation work."
