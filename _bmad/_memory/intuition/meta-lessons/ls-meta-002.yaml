trigger_pattern: "When observed system state doesn't match expected state or previous reports (e.g., 'I thought we had 8 lessons but now I see 3'), before concluding data loss, corruption, or system failure"
lesson_core: "First verify that the measurement method is consistent and correct. In the troubleshooting episode, Quinn reported '8 lessons' in multiple sessions but git showed only 3. Before concluding 5 lessons were lost, should have verified: HOW was the original count of 8 obtained? The investigation revealed the counting method was flawed (counting directories instead of files), not the data. Verify measurement before assuming failure."
