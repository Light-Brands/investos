  Three non-negotiable standards for financial models built via MCP:

  1. FORMULA-ONLY DERIVED CELLS: Every cell that derives from other data MUST use a formula
     (=reference or =calculation), never a static value. The MCP uses valueInputOption:
     USER_ENTERED which interprets = prefix as live formulas. Static values create dead data
     that silently becomes wrong as assumptions change. The Assumptions tab is the ONLY tab
     where raw input values are acceptable — every other tab must formula-reference back to
     Assumptions or to other formula-driven tabs.

  2. MONTH 1-N LABELING (NOT CALENDAR MONTHS): Column headers must use Month 1, Month 2...
     Month 12 for Year 1, Month 13-24 for Year 2, etc. — never Jan, Feb, Mar or calendar
     month names. This makes the model time-portable: investors can be told "we are on Month 7"
     regardless of when the company started. No relabeling needed when the fiscal year starts
     in a non-January month or when the model is presented at different times.

  3. YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH COLUMNS: Every monthly/annual data section must include YoY growth
     rate columns (% change from same month in prior year once Year 2+ data exists). This
     answers the investor's core question — "Is it accelerating?" — without requiring them
     to calculate it. Growth rates should be formulas: =IF(PriorYearCell=0,"N/A",(CurrentCell-PriorYearCell)/ABS(PriorYearCell))

  Origin: Building the Eliana Nutraceuticals 12-tab model required three full passes to convert
  static values to formulas. The calendar-month labeling created unnecessary coupling to a
  specific start date. These standards prevent both problems from recurring.
