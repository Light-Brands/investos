trigger_pattern: "When reporting system state counts (files, lessons, episodes, artifacts), especially when the count is used to make claims about system integrity or progress"
lesson_core: "Always count actual content files with explicit type filters (`find -name '*.yaml' -type f`), never use directory listings that can include subdirectories, headers, or navigation entries. In the troubleshooting episode, `ls -la lessons/` showed 8 subdirectories which were mistaken for 8 lesson files, causing false belief that 5 lessons were lost. The real count (3 files) was only discovered when using `find ... -type f | wc -l`."
