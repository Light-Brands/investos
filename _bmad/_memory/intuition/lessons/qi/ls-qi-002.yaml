trigger_pattern: "When building a multi-component system where artifacts depend on each other (tasks feed workflows, workflows feed manifests)"
lesson_core: "Structure implementation in strict dependency stages: foundation first (standalone tasks), then orchestration (workflows that invoke tasks), then registration (manifests that reference both). Within each stage, parallelize independent work. After all stages, run parallel verification checks (structural, pattern, cross-reference, manifest). This build-then-verify approach caught zero defects because the ordering prevented them."
