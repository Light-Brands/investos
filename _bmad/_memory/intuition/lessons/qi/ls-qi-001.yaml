trigger_pattern: "When implementing new artifacts that must follow established patterns in a framework with multiple conventions"
lesson_core: "Read ALL reference pattern files in parallel before writing any new code. This prevents rework from pattern mismatches and ensures consistency across the ecosystem. In the QI Phase 1 build, reading 7 reference files upfront (XML task, MD step-file workflow, YAML+instructions workflow, agent definition, config, schemas) meant zero rework across 15 new files."
