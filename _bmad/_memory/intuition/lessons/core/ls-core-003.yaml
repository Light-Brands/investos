trigger_pattern: "When writing ANY text output of any kind, including but not limited to documentation, proposals, strategy documents, technical specs, website copy, platform content, code comments, commit messages, PR descriptions, client communications, marketing materials, speaker notes, slide decks, README files, CLAUDE.md files, agent definitions, workflow descriptions, lesson files, or any other written artifact"
lesson_core: "Em dashes are prohibited in all output. This is non-negotiable and applies universally across every surface where we produce text. When an em dash would naturally be used, replace it with the appropriate alternative: a comma for parenthetical asides, a period to break into two sentences, the word 'and' or 'or' for conjunctions, a colon for introductions, or a restructured sentence that flows without needing the pause an em dash creates. The goal is clean, flowing prose that never relies on the em dash as a crutch. This applies to all character variants: the em dash (U+2014), the en dash (U+2013) used as an em dash, and double hyphens (--) used as em dash substitutes. Standard hyphens in compound words (e.g., 'AI-native', 'pre-money') are acceptable and not affected by this rule."
