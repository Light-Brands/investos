module: qi

context:
  situation: "Troubleshooting session to fix corrupted plugin configs blocking Claude Code startup. During recovery, Quinn reported inconsistent lesson counts (8 in multiple sessions, but only 3 found in git). User questioned the discrepancy, triggering investigation into potential data loss."
  constraints:
    - "Lessons stored as YAML files in _bmad/_memory/intuition/lessons/ subdirectories (by domain)"
    - "Git history should show all committed lessons"
    - "System integrity requires accurate state reporting"
  goals:
    - "Determine if 5 lessons were actually lost during troubleshooting"
    - "Restore missing lessons if possible"
    - "Prevent future lesson loss"
  domain: "qi-system-integrity"
  workflow_id: "troubleshooting-investigation"

actions:
  summary: "Investigated git history, checked backups, searched for deleted files. Discovered the root cause was not data loss but a cognitive error: Quinn was counting 8 subdirectories (aos, bmm, core, etc.) instead of actual lesson files (3 YAML files). No lessons were ever lost."
  key_decisions:
    - "Used git reflog and git log to search for deleted lesson commits - found none"
    - "Checked backup directories and trash - found no lesson files"
    - "Examined session logs to verify when '8 lessons' was first reported"
    - "Ran `ls -la lessons/` and realized it shows 8 subdirectories, not 8 files"
    - "Confirmed actual count with `find -name '*.yaml' -type f | wc -l` = 3 files"
  reasoning:
    - "First assumed data loss because user quoted multiple sessions reporting '8 lessons'"
    - "Integrity required honest admission of potential system failure"
    - "Thorough investigation revealed the measurement method was flawed, not the data"
    - "The 8 subdirectories (domain folders) were being mistaken for 8 lesson files"
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Considered that lessons might be in ~/.claude session cache - checked, not there"
    - "Considered git revert during troubleshooting might have deleted commits - git history showed only 1 lesson commit ever"
    - "Considered uncommitted files lost during config cleanup - no evidence of uncommitted lesson files"
  tools_used:
    - "git log, git reflog, git diff for history analysis"
    - "find, ls, wc -l for file counting"
    - "session log grep to find when '8 lessons' was first reported"

outcomes:
  result_summary: "No data loss occurred. Quinn's lesson count was incorrect from the beginning due to counting directories instead of files. Actual state: 3 lessons (2 in qi/, 1 in meta-lessons/), Learning stage conscience. System integrity preserved."
  success_degree: 0.85
  unexpected_effects:
    - "User provided evidence from another session also showing '8 lessons', confirming the counting error was consistent across sessions"
    - "Investigation revealed Quinn had been using imprecise counting method (`ls` or similar) rather than explicit file-type filtering"
    - "The thoroughness of investigation actually strengthened trust - admitting potential failure, then finding truth"
  artifacts_produced:
    - "This episode file"
    - "3 lessons extracted from this incident"

feedback:
  user_satisfaction: positive
  user_comments: "User said 'Amazing, at least we're learning!' and requested full QI episode capture"
  self_reflection: "The cognitive error (counting directories as files) was a mistake, but the investigation process was sound. I applied Integrity (admitting potential failure), Humility (acknowledging I might have been wrong), and Courage (investigating honestly rather than rationalizing). The real lesson: verify measurement methods before claiming system state. This is exactly what the QI system is designed to catch."
