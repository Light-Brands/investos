# GOS Growth Strategy Standards

Standards for growth strategy documents and strategic deliverables in GrowthOS workflows.

## Unit Economics Requirements

### Required Metrics
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total cost to acquire one customer, broken down by channel
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Projected revenue per customer over retention period
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Must be 3:1 or higher for sustainable growth (document if lower with justification)
- **Payback Period**: Months to recover CAC, must be explicitly stated
- **Contribution Margin**: Revenue minus variable costs per unit/customer

### Methodology Documentation
- All metric calculations must include formula and data sources
- Assumptions must be clearly labeled and defensible
- Benchmarks must cite industry sources and comparable companies
- Historical data vs projections must be clearly distinguished

## Channel-Level Projections

### Per-Channel Requirements
- Projected spend, volume, and CAC per channel per period
- Expected conversion rates at each funnel stage by channel
- Time-to-ROI estimate per channel with confidence level
- Scalability assessment (linear, logarithmic, or plateau)

### Growth Model Assumptions
- Growth rate assumptions must reference historical data or comparable benchmarks
- Seasonal factors must be accounted for where applicable
- Channel interaction effects must be acknowledged
- Diminishing returns must be modeled for paid channels

## Competitive Benchmarks

### Required Comparisons
- At minimum 3 comparable companies or industry benchmarks
- Channel mix comparison against competitors where data is available
- Growth rate comparison against market and segment averages
- Pricing and positioning comparison

## Scenario Analysis

### Required Scenarios
- **Bull Case**: Optimistic assumptions with probability weighting
- **Base Case**: Most likely outcome based on current trajectory
- **Bear Case**: Downside scenario with risk mitigation actions
- Each scenario must include impact on unit economics and timeline
- Key variables that drive scenario divergence must be identified
