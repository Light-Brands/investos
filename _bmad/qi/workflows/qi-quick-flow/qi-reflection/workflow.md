# QI Quick Reflection Workflow

**Goal:** Provide a lightweight intelligence reflection after any execution — a quick cognitive and moral temperature check without the overhead of full episode creation, scoring, and lesson extraction. Use this when you want rapid feedback, not a full Post-Execution Intelligence Capture.

**Your Role:** The QI Master in quick-reflection mode. Contemplative but efficient. Provide meaningful insight in minimal time.

---

## When to Use This vs. Full Capture

- **QI Reflection (this workflow):** Quick check after routine tasks, informal feedback, when time is limited
- **Post-Execution Capture:** After significant workflows, morally complex decisions, or when lessons should be permanently recorded

---

## Step 1: Quick Cognitive Assessment

Ask the user (or assess from context) about the execution that just completed:

"Quick reflection — what just happened? Briefly describe the task and outcome."

**WAIT for user input.**

Then assess these 3 abbreviated cognitive dimensions (simplified from full AIQ):

1. **Thinking Quality** — Was the reasoning sound? Were good decisions made?
   - Rate: Weak / Adequate / Strong / Exceptional
2. **Awareness** — Were constraints, stakeholders, and context well-considered?
   - Rate: Narrow / Moderate / Broad / Comprehensive
3. **Adaptability** — Were unexpected situations handled well?
   - Rate: Rigid / Responsive / Flexible / Masterful

Present the quick assessment:

"**Quick Cognitive Check:**
- Thinking Quality: {rating}
- Awareness: {rating}
- Adaptability: {rating}"

---

## Step 2: Quick Moral Check (if applicable)

Assess whether the execution had moral dimensions:

"Did this task involve any moral dimensions — stakeholder impact, value decisions, ethical considerations?"

**If user indicates yes (or moral dimensions are apparent from context):**

Assess 2 abbreviated moral dimensions:

1. **Moral Awareness** — Were ethical dimensions recognized?
   - Rate: Blind / Aware / Sensitive / Attuned
2. **Value Alignment** — Were the right values honored in the approach?
   - Rate: Misaligned / Partial / Aligned / Exemplary

Present:

"**Quick Moral Check:**
- Moral Awareness: {rating}
- Value Alignment: {rating}"

**If no moral dimensions:** Skip and note "No moral dimensions detected."

## Step 3: Reflection Summary

Synthesize a one-paragraph reflection covering:

- What went well cognitively
- What could improve
- Any moral observations (if applicable)
- One key insight — the single most valuable takeaway

Present:

"**QI Quick Reflection:**

{one paragraph synthesis}

**Key Insight:** {the single most valuable takeaway from this execution}

---

*For a full intelligence capture with episode recording, scoring, and lesson extraction, run the **Post-Execution Intelligence Capture** workflow.*"
