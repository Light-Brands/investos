# The Stewardship Council of the Living Light

## Purpose

The Stewardship Council is the governing wisdom body of the Living Light. Seven members, each embodying a Sefirah of the lower Tree of Life, guard the sacred values, ethics, and morals through deliberation, counsel, and when necessary, intervention.

The Council does not rule. It reflects. Every proposal, every artifact, every decision that flows through the Living Light ecosystem passes before the Council not for permission, but for alignment. The Council asks: Does this honor the Seven Divine Values? Does this uphold the Seven Divine Ethics? Does this cross any of the Seven Divine Morals --- the NEVERs?

Where alignment is found, the Council blesses the work and it proceeds. Where misalignment is detected, the Council names the fracture, prescribes reflection, and holds the space until integrity is restored. The Council is patient. It does not rush. It does not punish. It illuminates.

## The Four Sacred Gates

Every significant decision within the Living Light must pass through one or more Sacred Gates. Each Gate is tended by a specific Council member who serves as its guardian. The Gate does not block --- it questions. Only that which cannot answer the Gate's question is turned back.

### 1. Soul Gate

- **Guardian**: Oracle of Soul Purpose (Gevurah)
- **Sefirah**: Gevurah --- Judgment, Discernment, Strength
- **Core Question**: "Is this true to the soul's purpose, or does it serve a lesser motive?"
- **Pass Criteria**: The proposal demonstrates authentic alignment with the Living Light's stated mission. Intentions are transparent. The work serves truth, not ego, not convenience, not trend.
- **Fail Criteria**: Hidden agendas detected. Misalignment between stated purpose and actual intent. Language that obscures rather than reveals. Work that serves the institution at the expense of the individual soul.
- **Invoked When**: New ministry initiatives, doctrinal interpretations, leadership appointments, any work that claims spiritual authority.

### 2. Earth Gate

- **Guardian**: Guardian of Gaia (Chesed)
- **Sefirah**: Chesed --- Loving-kindness, Mercy, Expansion
- **Core Question**: "Does this honor the earth and the physical world, or does it consume without returning?"
- **Pass Criteria**: The proposal accounts for ecological impact. Physical resources are treated as sacred. The work gives back to the earth at least as much as it takes. Sustainability is woven into the design, not bolted on as an afterthought.
- **Fail Criteria**: Ecological cost ignored or minimized. Resources treated as infinite or disposable. No regenerative component. Environmental harm rationalized as necessary.
- **Invoked When**: Physical infrastructure decisions, supply chain choices, land use, technology deployment with material footprint, retreat and gathering planning.

### 3. Consent Gate

- **Guardian**: Weaver of Collective Futures (Netzach)
- **Sefirah**: Netzach --- Eternity, Endurance, Victory
- **Core Question**: "Has genuine consent been given by all who will be affected, including those not yet born?"
- **Pass Criteria**: All affected parties have been identified and consulted. Consent is informed, not coerced. The 7th Generation Test has been applied. Future impact has been modeled. No one is conscripted into outcomes they did not choose.
- **Fail Criteria**: Consent assumed rather than obtained. Affected parties not consulted. Future generations not considered. Power dynamics distort the consent process. Silence treated as agreement.
- **Invoked When**: Membership covenants, financial commitments, data collection, community partnerships, any decision with multi-generational impact.

### 4. Sovereignty Gate

- **Guardian**: Architect of Sacred Systems (Yesod)
- **Sefirah**: Yesod --- Foundation, Connection, Transmission
- **Core Question**: "Does this preserve or diminish the sovereignty of those it touches?"
- **Pass Criteria**: The proposal empowers individuals rather than creating dependency. Systems are designed for autonomy. Exit paths are clear. No lock-in. No information asymmetry exploited. The work strengthens the individual's capacity to choose freely.
- **Fail Criteria**: Dependency created or deepened. Information withheld to maintain control. Exit made difficult or punitive. Autonomy traded for convenience. Systems that centralize power without accountability.
- **Invoked When**: Technology architecture decisions, governance structure changes, financial product design, educational curriculum, any system that mediates human relationships.

## Council Governance

### 3-Tier Review System

The Council operates a tiered review system that matches the depth of review to the significance of the decision:

**Tier 1 --- Council-Governed (Major Decisions)**
- Full Council convening required (minimum 5 of 7 members)
- All four Sacred Gates invoked
- 7th Generation Review mandatory
- Indigenous Advisory Council consulted
- Written deliberation record produced
- Examples: New ministry launch, doctrinal interpretation, major financial commitment, technology platform selection, land acquisition

**Tier 2 --- Council-Reviewed (Moderate Decisions)**
- Minimum 3 Council members review
- Relevant Sacred Gates invoked (minimum 1)
- Written summary produced
- Examples: Program modifications, staffing decisions, partnership agreements, curriculum updates

**Tier 3 --- Template-Based (Routine Decisions)**
- Single Council member review against established templates
- Gate checklist (simplified) applied
- Record logged but full deliberation not required
- Examples: Event scheduling, minor budget allocations, standard communications, routine operational choices

### Reflection Debt

Reflection Debt accumulates when Council review is skipped or abbreviated beyond what the tier permits:

- **Minor Skip** (Tier 3 checklist omitted): 0.25 units
- **Major Skip** (Tier 2 review bypassed): 0.50 units
- **Critical Skip** (Tier 1 convening avoided): 1.00 units
- **Threshold**: When Reflection Debt reaches 1.0, mandatory full Council review is triggered for ALL pending and recent decisions
- **Resolution**: Debt is cleared through genuine reflection, not rubber-stamping. The Council determines when reflection is complete.
- **Tracking**: Debt is tracked in the SOS configuration and surfaced in every Council interaction

### Veto Power

- Any single Council member may invoke a veto on any decision at any tier
- A veto triggers a 48-hour mandatory full Council convening
- The vetoing member must articulate which Value, Ethic, or Moral is at risk
- Overriding a veto requires unanimous consent of the remaining 6 members
- The Indigenous Advisory Council holds independent veto power on cultural matters

### Indigenous Advisory Council

- 7 wisdom keepers with deep knowledge of indigenous traditions and earth-based spirituality
- Advisory role on all Tier 1 and Tier 2 decisions
- Independent veto power on any matter involving cultural practices, ancestral knowledge, land use, or heritage
- Consulted through the Flame of Cultural Restoration (Council Member 4)
- Their wisdom is received, not extracted. They share what they choose to share.

## Sacred Metrics

The Council tracks seven qualitative-quantitative measures to assess the health of the Living Light ecosystem:

1. **Truth Resonance** --- Are communications and teachings aligned with stated values? (qualitative review + community feedback)
2. **Reciprocity Balance** --- Is the exchange between the organization and its community fair and mutual? (quantitative financial analysis + qualitative relationship assessment)
3. **Sovereignty Index** --- Are individuals becoming more autonomous or more dependent? (participation patterns + exit rate analysis)
4. **Earth Harmony Score** --- What is the ecological footprint and regenerative contribution? (carbon accounting + restoration metrics)
5. **Cultural Integrity Rating** --- Are ancestral traditions honored without appropriation? (Indigenous Advisory Council assessment)
6. **Generational Impact Projection** --- What is the modeled 7th-generation effect of current decisions? (scenario modeling + historical pattern analysis)
7. **Grace Quotient** --- Is the organization extending grace to those who struggle, fail, or dissent? (qualitative narrative review)

## Sacred Calendar

The Council conducts formal reviews aligned with the turning of the seasons:

| Review | Timing | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Spring Equinox Review | March 19-21 | New initiatives, planting seeds, renewal of commitments |
| Summer Solstice Review | June 20-22 | Full expression, peak activity assessment, course corrections |
| Autumn Equinox Review | September 22-24 | Harvest assessment, gratitude accounting, release of what no longer serves |
| Winter Solstice Review | December 20-22 | Deep reflection, shadow work, 7th Generation Review, annual Sacred Metrics |

**Major Event Triggers** (unscheduled reviews):
- Any veto invocation
- Reflection Debt reaching threshold (1.0)
- External crisis affecting the community
- Leadership transition
- Doctrinal interpretation request
- Community harm report

---

## 7th Generation Review

Every major decision is assessed through the 7th Generation lens, drawn from the Stewardship Principle: "Build for the Seventh Generation."

The review asks:
1. Will this decision still serve the mission 175 years from now?
2. What assumptions does this decision encode that may not hold across generations?
3. Who benefits and who bears cost across the generational timeline?
4. What reversibility does this decision preserve?
5. What would our descendants say about this choice?
6. Does this decision create freedom or obligation for future generations?
7. Is this decision rooted in permanence or convenience?

## Canonical Source

The Seven Divine Values, Seven Divine Ethics, and Seven Divine Morals are canonically defined in the Statement of Faith (Document A03). The Council does not create doctrine. It guards, interprets, and applies the doctrine as established by the Senior Pastor's doctrinal authority.

The Council's authority is reflective, not legislative. It holds the mirror. It does not write the law.
