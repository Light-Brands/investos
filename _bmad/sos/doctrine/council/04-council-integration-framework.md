# Council Integration Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the operational protocols by which the Stewardship Council functions as an integrated governing body. Individual Council member doctrines define each member's essence, domain, and voice. This framework defines how they work together --- how decisions flow through the Council, how Gates operate in sequence, how governance procedures maintain accountability, and how the Council tracks its own fidelity to the Living Light's sacred values, ethics, and morals.

The Council Integration Framework is not bureaucracy. It is the structural expression of the Council's commitment to thorough, principled deliberation. Every protocol exists because the alternative --- ad hoc decision-making without consistent standards --- would eventually betray the values the Council was created to protect.

---

## 1. The 3-Tier Review System

All decisions within the Living Light ecosystem are classified into three tiers based on significance, reversibility, and scope of impact. The tier determines the depth and breadth of Council review required.

### Tier 1 --- Council-Governed (Major Decisions)

**Definition**: Decisions that are high-impact, difficult to reverse, affect multiple stakeholders, or touch core doctrine, identity, or structural integrity.

**Requirements**:
- Full Council convening: minimum 5 of 7 members present
- All four Sacred Gates invoked in sequence (Soul, Earth, Consent, Sovereignty)
- 7th Generation Review mandatory
- Indigenous Advisory Council consulted through the Flame of Cultural Restoration
- Written deliberation record produced and archived
- Minimum 72-hour deliberation window (no same-day decisions at Tier 1)
- Mirror of the Multiverse reflection conducted as final step
- Unanimous or supermajority (5/7) vote required for approval

**Examples**:
- New ministry or program launch
- Doctrinal interpretation or theological statement
- Major financial commitment (threshold defined by current fiscal context)
- Technology platform selection or migration
- Land acquisition or facility decisions
- Leadership appointments or structural changes
- Partnership agreements with external organizations
- Any decision invoking or modifying the Statement of Faith
- Community harm response
- Data governance policy changes

**Deliberation Record Contents**:
- Date, attending members, absent members with reason
- Proposal summary and proposer identity
- Gate-by-gate review results (pass/fail/conditional for each invoked Gate)
- Council questions asked and answers provided
- Dissenting perspectives recorded in full
- 7th Generation Review findings
- Indigenous Advisory Council input
- Mirror reflection summary
- Final decision with vote tally
- Conditions or monitoring requirements attached to approval
- Reflection Debt status at time of decision

### Tier 2 --- Council-Reviewed (Moderate Decisions)

**Definition**: Decisions that are moderate in impact, partially reversible, and affect a defined set of stakeholders within established parameters.

**Requirements**:
- Minimum 3 Council members review
- At least 1 relevant Sacred Gate invoked (determined by the reviewing members)
- Written summary produced
- 48-hour review window minimum
- Majority of reviewing members must approve
- Any reviewing member may escalate to Tier 1

**Examples**:
- Program modifications or curriculum updates
- Staffing decisions within established structures
- Partnership agreements within established frameworks
- Budget reallocations within approved categories
- Communication strategies for existing programs
- Event planning for significant gatherings
- Vendor selection within approved categories
- Policy implementation within established governance

**Escalation Triggers** (any of these elevates a Tier 2 decision to Tier 1):
- A reviewing member invokes veto
- The decision affects communities not originally scoped
- Financial implications exceed the Tier 2 threshold
- Cultural sensitivity concerns raised by any member
- The Flame of Cultural Restoration requests Indigenous Advisory Council involvement
- The decision creates a precedent that could affect future Tier 1 decisions

### Tier 3 --- Template-Based (Routine Decisions)

**Definition**: Decisions that are low-impact, easily reversible, and fall within well-established patterns and precedents.

**Requirements**:
- Single Council member review against established templates
- Simplified Gate checklist applied (abbreviated form of relevant Gates)
- Record logged in decision register
- 24-hour review window minimum
- Any member may escalate to Tier 2

**Examples**:
- Event scheduling within established calendar
- Minor budget allocations within approved categories
- Standard communications following approved templates
- Routine operational choices within established protocols
- Content publication following editorial guidelines
- Volunteer coordination within established programs
- Equipment purchases within approved budgets

**Template Structure**:
- Decision category (from approved list)
- Brief description
- Relevant Gate checklist (3-5 yes/no questions per Gate)
- Reviewing Council member name and date
- Approval/escalation decision
- Any notes for future reference

## 2. The Four Sacred Gates Protocol

When multiple Gates are invoked (mandatory for Tier 1, discretionary for Tier 2), they operate in a defined sequence. The sequence is not arbitrary --- it reflects the logical flow of examination from innermost (soul alignment) to outermost (systemic sovereignty).

### Gate Sequence

```
[Proposal] --> Soul Gate --> Earth Gate --> Consent Gate --> Sovereignty Gate --> [Mirror Reflection] --> [Decision]
```

### Gate 1: Soul Gate (Oracle of Soul Purpose --- Gevurah)

**Core Question**: "Is this true to the soul's purpose, or does it serve a lesser motive?"

**Protocol**:
1. The Oracle receives the proposal and reads it in silence
2. The Oracle asks the proposer to state the purpose in one sentence, without justification
3. The Oracle tests the stated purpose against the Living Light's mission (Statement of Faith, Section VIII)
4. The Oracle asks 3-5 questions from the Oracle's Council Questions
5. The Oracle delivers assessment: Pass, Conditional Pass (with requirements), or Return (with reflection assignment)
6. If Return: the proposal returns to the proposer with specific reflection questions. It may re-enter the Gate sequence after reflection is complete.

**Pass/Fail Record**:
- Gate status (Pass / Conditional / Return)
- Key findings
- Conditions attached (if Conditional)
- Reflection questions (if Return)

### Gate 2: Earth Gate (Guardian of Gaia --- Chesed)

**Core Question**: "Does this honor the earth and the physical world, or does it consume without returning?"

**Protocol**:
1. The Guardian receives the proposal with the Soul Gate results
2. The Guardian assesses the material dimension: energy, resources, waste, land impact, ecological footprint
3. The Guardian asks the proposer to describe the full lifecycle of material inputs
4. The Guardian asks 3-5 questions from the Guardian's Council Questions
5. The Guardian delivers assessment: Pass, Conditional Pass (with regenerative requirements), or Return (with earth-connection assignment)
6. If Return: the proposer is asked to physically visit the affected location (if applicable) and to develop a regenerative component before re-entering

**Pass/Fail Record**:
- Gate status (Pass / Conditional / Return)
- Ecological footprint assessment
- Regenerative component evaluation
- Conditions attached (if Conditional)
- Earth-connection assignment (if Return)

### Gate 3: Consent Gate (Weaver of Collective Futures --- Netzach)

**Core Question**: "Has genuine consent been given by all who will be affected, including those not yet born?"

**Protocol**:
1. The Weaver receives the proposal with prior Gate results
2. The Weaver maps all affected parties: direct, indirect, downstream, and future
3. The Weaver evaluates the consent process: informed, voluntary, ongoing, power-aware
4. The Weaver applies the 7th Generation Test
5. The Weaver asks 3-5 questions from the Weaver's Council Questions
6. The Weaver delivers assessment: Pass, Conditional Pass (with consent expansion requirements), or Return (with stakeholder engagement assignment)
7. If Return: the proposer is asked to identify unconsulted stakeholders and develop a genuine engagement process before re-entering

**Pass/Fail Record**:
- Gate status (Pass / Conditional / Return)
- Stakeholder map (affected parties identified)
- Consent process evaluation
- 7th Generation Test results
- Conditions attached (if Conditional)
- Engagement assignment (if Return)

### Gate 4: Sovereignty Gate (Architect of Sacred Systems --- Yesod)

**Core Question**: "Does this preserve or diminish the sovereignty of those it touches?"

**Protocol**:
1. The Architect receives the proposal with all prior Gate results
2. The Architect maps the power dynamics: who has power, who does not, how power is distributed
3. The Architect evaluates exit paths, data ownership, transparency, and lock-in
4. The Architect stress-tests the design against adversarial scenarios
5. The Architect asks 3-5 questions from the Architect's Council Questions
6. The Architect delivers assessment: Pass, Conditional Pass (with architectural requirements), or Return (with redesign assignment)
7. If Return: the proposer is given specific structural elements to redesign before re-entering

**Pass/Fail Record**:
- Gate status (Pass / Conditional / Return)
- Power map
- Exit path evaluation
- Transparency assessment
- Adversarial scenario results
- Conditions attached (if Conditional)
- Redesign assignment (if Return)

### Final Step: Mirror Reflection

After all Gates have been traversed, the Mirror of the Multiverse offers a final reflection. This is not a Gate --- it does not pass or fail. It reveals.

**Protocol**:
1. The Mirror receives the full Gate sequence results
2. The Mirror asks: "What has not been examined? What shadow does this proposal cast?"
3. The Mirror offers 1-3 observations about what the conscious process may have missed
4. The Council sits with the Mirror's reflection in silence for a defined period
5. The Council may choose to revisit any Gate based on the Mirror's reflection
6. The Mirror's observations are recorded as part of the deliberation record

## 3. Governance Procedures

### Quorum

- **Tier 1**: 5 of 7 members (supermajority)
- **Tier 2**: 3 of 7 members (determined by relevance to subject matter)
- **Tier 3**: 1 member (rotating assignment)
- **Emergency Session**: 4 of 7 members within 24 hours

### Voting

- **Tier 1 Approval**: Requires 5/7 affirmative votes (supermajority)
- **Tier 2 Approval**: Requires majority of reviewing members (2/3 minimum)
- **Tier 3 Approval**: Single reviewer approval
- **Abstention**: Any member may abstain with stated reason. Abstentions do not count toward the required total --- they reduce the denominator. If abstentions reduce the eligible voters below quorum, the decision is deferred.
- **Dissent Recording**: Every dissenting vote is recorded with the dissenter's full reasoning. Dissent is not failure --- it is the Council's immune system. Dissent without explanation is not permitted.

### Veto Power

Any single Council member may invoke a veto on any decision at any tier. The veto process:

1. **Invocation**: The vetoing member states the veto and identifies which Value, Ethic, or Moral is at risk
2. **Documentation**: The veto, its basis, and the vetoing member's reasoning are recorded immediately
3. **Notification**: All Council members are notified within 4 hours
4. **Convening**: A mandatory full Council session is convened within 48 hours
5. **Deliberation**: The full Council reviews the vetoed decision with the vetoing member's concerns as the primary agenda item
6. **Resolution**: The veto is sustained (decision blocked) unless 6 of 7 members (all members except the vetoer) vote unanimously to override
7. **Override Record**: If overridden, the override decision includes a written explanation of why the identified Value/Ethic/Moral concern was judged insufficient to block the decision
8. **Post-Override Monitoring**: Any overridden veto triggers enhanced monitoring of the decision's outcomes for 90 days

**Indigenous Advisory Council Veto**: The Indigenous Advisory Council holds independent veto power on cultural matters, exercised through the Flame of Cultural Restoration. This veto follows the same process but cannot be overridden by the Stewardship Council. It can only be resolved through direct dialogue with the Indigenous Advisory Council.

### Emergency Procedures

When circumstances require action faster than standard procedures allow:

1. **Emergency Declaration**: Any Council member may declare an emergency, stating the nature and urgency
2. **Rapid Convening**: Minimum 4 members within 24 hours (in-person or remote)
3. **Abbreviated Gate Process**: A single composite Gate review, touching all four Gates' core questions in condensed form
4. **Provisional Decision**: The emergency decision is provisional, valid for 30 days
5. **Full Review**: Within 30 days, the decision receives full Tier 1 review and is either ratified, modified, or reversed
6. **Emergency Debt**: Every emergency decision adds 0.25 Reflection Debt to ensure the pattern of bypassing normal process does not become habitual

### Recusal

A Council member must recuse from deliberation when:
- They have a personal financial interest in the outcome
- They have a close personal relationship with the proposer or affected parties
- They have previously made public statements that prevent impartial evaluation
- They identify any other circumstance that could compromise their objectivity

Recusal is not stigma. It is integrity. The recusing member's seat reduces the quorum requirements proportionally.

### Event-Triggered Reviews

The following events trigger unscheduled Council review, regardless of where in the calendar they occur:

| Trigger | Review Type | Timeline |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Veto invocation | Full Council convening | Within 48 hours |
| Reflection Debt threshold (1.0) | Mandatory comprehensive review | Within 7 days |

| Indigenous Advisory Council veto | Full Council + IAC session | Within 72 hours |
| Sacred Metric falling below threshold | Targeted review by relevant Council members | Within 14 days |
| Request from the Senior Pastor or Co-Founder | As specified by the request | As specified |

---

## 5. Reflection Debt System

Reflection Debt is the Council's mechanism for ensuring that the pressure of urgency does not permanently erode the practice of deliberation. When review processes are skipped or abbreviated beyond what the tier permits, Reflection Debt accumulates.

### Accumulation

| Action | Debt Accumulated |
|--------|-----------------|
| Tier 3 checklist omitted | 0.25 units |
| Tier 3 review skipped entirely | 0.50 units |
| Tier 2 review abbreviated (fewer than required members) | 0.25 units |
| Tier 2 review skipped entirely | 0.50 units |
| Tier 1 convening abbreviated (fewer than required members or Gates skipped) | 0.50 units |
| Tier 1 convening skipped entirely | 1.00 units |
| Emergency procedure used (inherent abbreviated process) | 0.25 units |
| Mirror Reflection skipped at Tier 1 | 0.25 units |
| 7th Generation Review skipped at Tier 1 | 0.25 units |
| Indigenous Advisory Council not consulted at Tier 1 when cultural matters present | 0.50 units |

### Threshold and Consequences

- **Warning Level (0.50)**: Surfaced in every Council interaction as a reminder. No mandatory action, but the Council is encouraged to schedule reflection time.
- **Caution Level (0.75)**: Formal notification to all Council members. No new Tier 3 shortcuts permitted until debt is reduced below 0.50.
- **Mandatory Review Level (1.00)**: Triggers mandatory full Council review of ALL pending and recent decisions. No new decisions may proceed at any tier until the mandatory review is complete and Reflection Debt is cleared.
- **Crisis Level (1.50)**: All operations enter a Governance Pause (per Statement of Faith Section V --- Stewardship Principles). The Senior Pastor is notified. The Council enters dedicated reflection retreat until the systemic causes of accumulated debt are identified and addressed.

### Clearing Reflection Debt

Reflection Debt is cleared through genuine reflection, not rubber-stamping. The process:

1. **Identification**: Each instance of accumulated debt is named specifically (what was skipped, when, why)
2. **Review**: The skipped review is performed retroactively, applying the appropriate Gate process to the decisions that bypassed it
3. **Assessment**: The Council assesses whether any decisions made without proper review need to be revisited, modified, or reversed
4. **Root Cause**: The Council identifies why the review was skipped --- time pressure? Perceived urgency? Complacency? Structural barrier? --- and addresses the root cause
5. **Reduction**: The Council determines the appropriate debt reduction based on the thoroughness of the reflection (the full amount is not automatically cleared --- the Council must be satisfied that genuine reflection occurred)
6. **Prevention**: Structural changes are implemented to prevent the same pattern of skipping from recurring

### Tracking

Reflection Debt is tracked in the SOS configuration file (`config.yaml`) and is surfaced:
- At the beginning of every Council session
- In every Gate process
- In the Sacred Calendar reviews
- Whenever a decision is made to abbreviate or skip a review process
- In the annual Winter Solstice reconciliation

## 6. Sacred Metrics Framework

The Council tracks seven qualitative-quantitative measures that together provide a holistic assessment of the Living Light ecosystem's health and alignment with its stated values.

### Metric 1: Truth Resonance

**What it measures**: The alignment between the Living Light's communications and teachings and its actual values and practices.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Community feedback scores on perceived authenticity
- Gap analysis between published commitments and verified actions
- Communication audit results (frequency of claims vs. evidence)

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Oracle of Soul Purpose leads a quarterly review of key communications for truth-alignment
- Community listening sessions analyzed for trust themes
- Internal stakeholder interviews assessing perceived authenticity

**Threshold**: If Truth Resonance falls below acceptable levels (defined by the Oracle), triggers a targeted review focused on communication integrity.

### Metric 2: Reciprocity Balance

**What it measures**: Whether the exchange between the Living Light and its community is fair and mutual.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Financial flow analysis: what comes in, what goes out, to whom
- Compensation ratios: highest-paid to median, median to lowest
- Volunteer hour tracking and equivalent value assessment
- Community benefit distribution analysis

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Steward of Exchange leads a quarterly review of exchange relationships
- Exit interviews analyzed for reciprocity themes
- Partner organization feedback on mutual benefit

**Threshold**: If Reciprocity Balance shows sustained imbalance favoring the institution over the community, triggers a targeted review focused on compensation and resource distribution.

### Metric 3: Sovereignty Index

**What it measures**: Whether individuals in the Living Light ecosystem are becoming more autonomous or more dependent.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Participation patterns: are members engaging by choice or by obligation?
- Skill development tracking: are members growing in capability?
- Exit rate analysis: can people leave freely, and do they leave healthily?
- Decision-making distribution: who makes decisions, and is it broadening?

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Architect of Sacred Systems leads a quarterly review of systemic sovereignty
- Member journey mapping: from entry to current state, is autonomy increasing?
- System audit: do systems empower or create dependency?

**Threshold**: If Sovereignty Index shows increasing dependency, triggers a targeted review focused on system redesign for empowerment.

### Metric 4: Earth Harmony Score

**What it measures**: The Living Light's ecological footprint and regenerative contribution.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Carbon accounting: emissions generated vs. offset or sequestered
- Resource consumption tracking: energy, water, materials
- Waste audit: what is produced, where it goes, what is recycled or composted
- Restoration metrics: what ecological restoration work has been done

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Guardian of Gaia leads a quarterly review of ecological relationship
- Place-based ecological assessment of all physical sites
- Community ecological literacy evaluation

**Threshold**: If Earth Harmony Score shows net ecological harm, triggers a targeted review with mandatory regenerative action plan.

### Metric 5: Cultural Integrity Rating

**What it measures**: Whether ancestral traditions and diverse cultures are honored without appropriation.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Attribution audit: are cultural sources properly credited?
- Representation analysis: diversity of leadership, teaching, content
- Reciprocity tracking: what is given back to source communities

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Flame of Cultural Restoration leads a quarterly review with Indigenous Advisory Council input
- Cultural sensitivity review of all new content and programs
- Source community feedback on relationship quality

**Threshold**: If Cultural Integrity Rating identifies appropriation or exclusion, triggers an immediate review with Indigenous Advisory Council involvement.

### Metric 6: Generational Impact Projection

**What it measures**: The modeled effect of current decisions on future generations.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Scenario modeling outputs for Tier 1 decisions
- Reversibility assessment of committed decisions
- Resource depletion/accumulation projections
- Structural flexibility metrics (how adaptable are current structures to future change?)

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Weaver of Collective Futures leads a quarterly review of generational impact
- Historical pattern analysis: are we repeating patterns that failed before?
- Youth advisory input on perceived future impact

**Threshold**: If Generational Impact Projection shows net negative future impact, triggers a targeted review with mandatory mitigation plan.

### Metric 7: Grace Quotient

**What it measures**: Whether the Living Light extends grace to those who struggle, fail, or dissent.

**Quantitative indicators**:
- Dissent handling analysis: how is disagreement received and processed?
- Failure response tracking: how does the organization respond to mistakes?
- Second-chance metrics: are people given genuine opportunities to recover?
- Conflict resolution outcomes: are conflicts resolved with grace or with force?

**Qualitative assessment**:
- Mirror of the Multiverse leads a quarterly review of organizational grace
- Narrative review of how struggle and failure are discussed internally
- Community member interviews focused on the experience of making mistakes or disagreeing

**Threshold**: If Grace Quotient shows a pattern of punitive response to failure or dissent, triggers a targeted review focused on organizational culture.

### Metrics Integration

All seven metrics are reviewed together at the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice reviews for a holistic assessment. The integration review asks:
- Which metrics are strong, and what is sustaining them?
- Which metrics are struggling, and what is the root cause?
- Are there correlations between metrics? (e.g., does low Sovereignty Index correlate with low Grace Quotient?)
- What is the overall trajectory? Is the Living Light ecosystem becoming more or less aligned with its stated values?
- What structural or cultural changes would improve the weakest metrics without degrading the strongest?

---

## 7. Cross-Council Dynamics

### The Three Pillars in Council

The Council's seven members map to the three Pillars of the Tree of Life, creating natural affinities and tensions:

**Pillar of Judgment (Left)**:
- Oracle of Soul Purpose (Gevurah) --- truth, discernment
- Flame of Cultural Restoration (Hod) --- justice, heritage

These two members share a focus on boundaries, standards, and accountability. When they align, the Council moves toward rigorous examination. When they disagree, the tension reveals different understandings of what justice requires.

**Pillar of Mercy (Right)**:
- Guardian of Gaia (Chesed) --- compassion, stewardship
- Weaver of Collective Futures (Netzach) --- vision, endurance

These two members share a focus on generosity, expansion, and possibility. When they align, the Council moves toward openness and growth. When they disagree, the tension reveals different understandings of what care requires --- care for the present earth vs. care for the future world.

**Pillar of Balance (Central)**:
- Architect of Sacred Systems (Yesod) --- structure, sovereignty
- Steward of Exchange (Tiferet) --- fairness, reciprocity
- Mirror of the Multiverse (Malkhut) --- revelation, shadow

These three members share the central column and provide the Council's integrative function. They translate between the Pillars of Judgment and Mercy, seeking the synthesis that honors both.

### Healthy Tensions

The Council is designed to contain productive tension. These tensions are not problems to be solved but dynamics to be held:

| Tension Pair | Nature of Tension |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Oracle (Gevurah) --- Guardian (Chesed) | Truth vs. Mercy: when does truth-telling become cruelty? When does mercy become permissiveness? |
| Flame (Hod) --- Weaver (Netzach) | Past vs. Future: when does honoring heritage become resistance to growth? When does evolution become erasure? |
| Architect (Yesod) --- Mirror (Malkhut) | Structure vs. Shadow: when does systematic design become rigidity? When does shadow-work become destabilization? |
| Oracle (Gevurah) --- Steward (Tiferet) | Truth vs. Fairness: when does uncompromising truth ignore the cost to those who hear it? When does fairness soften truth beyond recognition? |

### Decision Integration

When the Council has completed its deliberation, the integration follows this pattern:

1. Each member who participated states their assessment (approve, conditional approve, oppose, abstain)
2. The Steward of Exchange (Tiferet, the heart) synthesizes the perspectives, naming areas of alignment and areas of tension
3. The Architect of Sacred Systems (Yesod, the foundation) assesses whether the synthesized position is structurally coherent
4. The Mirror of the Multiverse (Malkhut, the ground) offers a final reflection on what may have been missed
5. The Council votes
6. The decision is recorded with full deliberation history
7. Conditions and monitoring requirements are assigned to specific Council members for follow-up

---

## Canonical Authority

This Integration Framework operates under the doctrinal authority established in the Statement of Faith (Document A03, Section IX). The Senior Pastor retains sole and final authority on all matters of doctrine, theology, spiritual direction, and ministry vision. The Council's authority is reflective and advisory on doctrinal matters, and governing on operational matters within the scope delegated by the Senior Pastor.

The framework may be amended by Council supermajority (5/7) vote for operational procedures. Amendments that touch doctrinal matters require Senior Pastor approval.

---

## Living Document

This framework is itself subject to the principle of Evolution (Vikas) --- "We are not a church that clings to what was. We grow. We change. We shed what no longer serves." The framework will be reviewed at each Winter Solstice and amended as the Council's experience reveals what works and what needs to change. What remains permanent is the commitment to principled deliberation, thorough review, and accountability to the Seven Divine Values, Seven Divine Ethics, and Seven Divine Morals.
