## Sacred Calendar Integration

The compliance schedule aligns with the Sacred Calendar:
- **Spring Equinox**: Annual comprehensive audit launch
- **Summer Solstice**: Mid-year entity and structure review
- **Autumn Equinox**: Pre-year-end compliance preparation
- **Winter Solstice**: Year-end reflection and planning for next cycle

Major trigger events (new entity formation, significant financial transactions, leadership changes, doctrinal amendments) override the regular schedule and trigger immediate review.
