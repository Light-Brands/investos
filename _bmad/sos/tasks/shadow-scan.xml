        1. Klippat Sheker (Falsehood) — What is being presented as true that isn't?

        3. Klippat Pirud (Fragmentation) — What is divided that should be whole?
        4. Klippat Shikchah (Forgetting) — What has been erased or ignored?
        5. Klippat Kfiut (Stagnation) — Where has growth stopped?
        6. Klippat Oshek (Oppression) — Who is being diminished or exploited?
        7. Klippat Ha'alamah (Concealment) — What is being hidden, and why?
