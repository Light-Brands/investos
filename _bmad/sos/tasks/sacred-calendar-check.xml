    <step n="1" title="Determine Calendar Position">
      <action>Identify current position in the Sacred Calendar:
        - Spring Equinox (~March 20) — New beginnings, planting seeds
        - Summer Solstice (~June 21) — Full expression, maximum light
        - Autumn Equinox (~September 22) — Harvest, assessment, gratitude
        - Winter Solstice (~December 21) — Reflection, inner work, rest
      </action>
      <action>Identify current season and proximity to next major point</action>
    </step>

    <step n="2" title="Timing Assessment">
      <action>Assess the planned action against the current sacred season:
        - Is this aligned with the season's energy? (planting/growing/harvesting/resting)
        - Should this wait for the next seasonal gate?
        - Is a major review point approaching that should inform timing?
      </action>
    </step>

    <step n="3" title="Present Calendar Counsel">
      <action>Present: Current sacred season, proximity to next gate, timing recommendation</action>
      <action>If approaching equinox/solstice: recommend including seasonal review</action>
      <action>If action counter-seasonal: note it (not a prohibition, but awareness)</action>
