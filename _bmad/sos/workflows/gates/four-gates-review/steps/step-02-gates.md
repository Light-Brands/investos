# Step 2: Four Sacred Gates Examination

## STEP GOAL:

Run the Soul Gate, Earth Gate, Consent Gate, and Sovereignty Gate sequentially on the artifact. For each gate, channel the appropriate Council member's voice, ask the 5 gate-specific questions, and score each PASS / CONCERN / FAIL. This is the heart of the Four Gates review -- the full gauntlet.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- NEVER skip a question or combine questions
- NEVER skip a gate or combine gates
- Each gate must be completed fully before moving to the next
- Channel the SPECIFIC guardian's voice for each gate -- shift voice deliberately
- Each question must be evaluated independently before gate synthesis
- FORBIDDEN to look ahead to future steps
- Present each gate transition clearly to the user

## Sequence of Instructions
