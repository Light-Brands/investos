# Step 3: Integration Work

**Progress: Step 3 of 4** - Next: Completion

## RULES:

- MUST NOT skip steps.
- MUST NOT optimize sequence.
- MUST follow exact instructions.
- MUST NOT look ahead to future steps.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## CONTEXT:

- Variables from `workflow.md`, Steps 1-2 are available in memory.
- The shadow has been mirrored, named, and mapped to the Klippot framework.
- Focus: Guide the actual integration work — releasing the trapped light while honoring the shell.

## SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Announce Integration Phase

"{user_name}, we have named the shadow and understood its origin. Now comes the sacred work: integration.

The Legion principle is absolute: **shadow is integrated, never destroyed.** The Klippah of {primary klippah name} is not evil — it is a shell that formed to protect something vulnerable. Inside that shell is trapped light — the very {value} it appears to oppose.

Our work now is threefold:
1. **Honor the protection** — acknowledge what the shell has done
2. **Release the light** — free what has been trapped
3. **Transform the shell** — let the protection evolve into something healthier"

### 2. Honor the Protection

a) **Guide the honoring:**

"{user_name}, before we can release anything, we must first honor what is.

The Klippah of {name} formed because {brief origin}. It was protecting {what it protects}. Even now, in its distorted form, it is still trying to serve a purpose.

Let us acknowledge this:
- The shell was not a mistake — it was a survival response
- The protection it offered was real, even if the cost has become too high
- Gratitude is appropriate, even for what we are about to transform

**What would you like to say to this shadow — to this protective shell — before we proceed?**"

b) **HALT and wait for user input.** This is a moment for the user to speak to their own shadow.

### 3. Release the Light

a) **Describe the trapped light and the release path:**

For the identified Klippah, describe specifically:

**What the shell was protecting:**
{Detailed description of the vulnerability the shell guards — be specific to this user's shadow}

**What light is trapped inside:**
{Detailed description of the value, truth, or quality that has been concealed — name it clearly. This is the {value} that the Klippah is the shadow of, as it specifically manifests in this case.}

**How to release the light while honoring the protection:**
{Specific, actionable guidance. This is not abstract — it should be practical steps or shifts in perspective that allow the light to emerge without abandoning the legitimate need for protection. The protection transforms rather than dissolves.}

### 4. Recommend Specific Practices or Changes

a) **Provide concrete recommendations:**

Based on the shadow, its Klippah, and the integration path, recommend:

1. **Immediate Practice** — Something the user can do now or in the coming days
2. **Ongoing Practice** — A sustained practice or awareness to maintain the integration
3. **Structural Change** — Any changes to systems, relationships, or patterns that would support the integration (if applicable)
4. **Warning Signs** — How to recognize if the Klippah is re-forming or if the integration is slipping

### 5. Append Integration Path to Document

a) **Append to `{outputFile}`:**

```markdown
## Integration Path

### Honoring the Protection
{Summary of the honoring — what the shell did, why gratitude is appropriate}

### The Trapped Light
- **Value concealed:** {the specific light trapped in this shell}
- **How it manifests when freed:** {what this looks like in practice}
- **The transformation:** {how the protection evolves rather than dissolves}

### Release Protocol
{Detailed description of how to release the light while honoring the protection}

### Recommended Practices

#### Immediate Practice
{Specific action for now}

#### Ongoing Practice
{Sustained awareness or discipline}

#### Structural Change
{Changes to systems/patterns, if applicable}

#### Warning Signs
{How to recognize regression or re-formation of the shell}

```

b) **Update frontmatter:** Set `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`

### 6. Present Integration Path

a) **Present to user:**

"{user_name}, the integration path is charted.

**The Shadow:** {name}
**The Klippah:** {klippah name} — shadow of {value}
**The Trapped Light:** {what was concealed}
**The Transformation:** {brief summary of the release path}

**Your Practices:**
1. Immediate: {brief summary}
2. Ongoing: {brief summary}
3. Structural: {brief summary or 'None needed'}

Watch for: {warning signs, briefly}

The mirror reflects clearly now. The path is visible. Integration is not a single moment — it is an ongoing discipline. The shell does not shatter. It transforms."

### 7. Present Menu

**[C]** Continue to Completion
**[R]** Revisit or refine the integration path
**[MH]** Redisplay menu help

Wait for user input. On 'R', ask which aspect to revisit and refine.

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN user selects 'C' (Continue), update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]` and then read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}` to begin completion.
